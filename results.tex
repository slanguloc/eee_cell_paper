%% Firing rates specific to cell, layer, sublayer; comparison with in vivo
Simulations of M1 (\fref{fig_spont}A) exhibit spontaneous firing rates between 0 and 10 Hz for all populations, consistent with the experimental litearature \cite{Isom09,LiDa16}. The sublaminar specificity of connections is evidenced by the gradual decrease of PT activity as cortical depth increases within layer 5B, reflecting experimental observations \cite{Ande10}. The circuit also showed emergence of physiological oscillations in the beta and gamma range (\fref{fig_spont}B)  consistent with in vivo data \cite{Cast13,Rubi06}. These oscillations emerged in the absence of rhythmic external inputs.

Differnet combinations of long-range inputs and H-current levels lead to different modes of operation in M1. Increased rates (20 Hz) in PO, S1 and S2 inputs together with an upregulated H-current favored an IT/CT-predominant mode (with low PT activity) \fref{fig_IT_mode}. The same long-range input levels with H-current downregulated lead to a mixed mode where upper layer IT cells in turn activated PT cells \fref{fig_mixed_mode}. Downregulation of H-current facilitated synaptic integration of inputs and increased PT output activity. This constitutes one of the pathways that can generate corticospinal output: sensory-related inputs projecting to superficial IT neurons in turn exciting PT cells.

Increased activation of VL, cM1 and M2 inputs with downregulated H-current promoted a PT-predominant mode \fref{fig_PT_mode}. This evidences a second pathway that can result in corticospinal output: motor-related inputs bypassing upper M1 layers and directly projecting to PT cells. As with sensory-related inputs, upregulation of H-curerent in corticospinal cells also decreased their activity.

- Effect of dendritic distribution of synapses (sCRACM data) on circuit dynamics and neural coding (SfN16 poster).

- Map resonance for different layer inputs (SA 4.2); develop test-set (SA 4.3); 100ms input to different layers, freqs and phases; measure resonance, constructive/destructive interference

- Present time-varying signals to networks (SA 4.4); 2 time-varying signal (different target cells and spectral properties), separate and simultaneously to L2/3; measure rates, LFP, nTE, Granger in L5A IT and L5B PT; how is signal transformed?

 - Wiring perturbations (structure-function relations) (SA 4.5); L2/3 strong effect; L2/3->L5 hyperconn -> autism
 
- Simultaneous activation of inputs e.g. thalamus and vS1 -> vM1\cite{Hook15}

- Study more in depth effect of H-current on spatial and temporal integration L2/3 inputs to PT (already have results reproducing figs 4, 7, 8, 9 and 11 from Sheets, 2011)

- Evaluate STR-SPI transformation hypothesis (rate vs temporal coding) via temporal-variability measures.

- Reproduce data in Dembrow, 2015: IT dendrites functioned as temporal integrators, particularly responsive to dendritic inputs within the gamma freq range (40 â€“140 Hz); PT dendrites acted as coincidence detectors, responding to spatially distributed signals in a narrow time window.

- Study role of interneurons: interlaminar disynaptic interactions (E->I->E); replicate ratios in Yamawaki,2015.

- Compare oscillations in different layers (eg. alpha=suppress -- use Lakatos paper, gamma=info flow, beta=resting?)

- Study correlations and synchrony: spike-triggered average; auto- and cross-correlations between spike trains; joint peri stimulus time histograms; cross-level coupling (CLC); spike train synchrony measures; Pairwise Phase consistency (PPC)

- Study effect of low vs high frequency synaptic inputs on network (the network analogous of cell synaptic resonance in apical dendrites for high frequencies)
