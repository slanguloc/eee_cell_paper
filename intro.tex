\section{Introduction} 

% Plateaus have been observed in vitro

% There is also evidence of plateaus in vivo

% What is the importance of plateaus? -- We hypothesize EEE

\note{Srdjan was saying we shouldn't discuss EEE in this paper}

% What kinds of stimulation can produce plateaus?

% What is spread and how does it affect other basals and apical dend?

% We start with a simplified model to thoroughly explore param space, particularly wrt different assumptions about the role of spines
