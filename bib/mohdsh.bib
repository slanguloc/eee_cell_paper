Over the past decade, there has been replicated evidence demonstrating the rapid and potent antidepressant effects of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Moreover, preclinical and biomarker studies have begun to elucidate the mechanism underlying the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, offering a new window into the biology of depression and identifying a plethora of potential treatment targets. This article discusses the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ketamine, summarizes the neurobiology of depression, reviews the mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, and discusses the prospects for next-generation rapid-acting antidepressants.},

  abstract    = {Existing standardized diagnostic interviews are not used by psychiatrists in clinical settings. There is an urgent need for a clinician-administered tool for assessment of adult psychopathology that produces dimensional measures, in addition to categorical diagnoses.The Standard for Clinicians' Interview in Psychiatry (SCIP) was designed to be used in clinical settings and generates dimensional measures. The reliability of the SCIP was tested at six sites: one hospital and two clinics in USA, two hospitals in Egypt and one clinic in Canada. Participants were adult patients who were admitted for inpatient psychiatric treatment or came for regular office visits in the outpatient clinic. Refusal rate was <1\%. Missing data were <1.1\%. Patients with dementia, mental retardation or serious medical conditions were excluded. A total of 1,004 subjects were interviewed between 2000 and 2012.Inter-rater reliability (Kappa) was measured for 150 SCIP items: 116 items (77.3\%) had good reliability (Kappa>0.7), 28 items (18.7\%) had fair reliability (Kappa ranges from 0.5 to 0.7) and six items (4\%) had poor reliability (Kappa<0.5). Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency was measured for the SCIP dimensions: anxiety, posttraumatic stress, depression, mania, hallucinations, Schneider first-rank symptoms, delusions, disorganized thoughts, disorganized behavior, negative symptoms, alcohol addiction, drug addiction, attention and hyperactivity. All of the SCIP dimensions had substantial Cronbach's alpha values (>0.7) with the exception of disorganized thoughts (Cronbach's alpha=0.375).The SCIP is a reliable tool for assessing psychological symptoms, signs and dimensions of the main psychiatric diagnoses.},

  abstract    = {Our central question is why the hippocampal CA3 region is the only cortical area capable of forming interference-free representations of complex environmental events (episodes), given that apparently all cortical regions have recurrent excitatory circuits with modifiable synapses, the basic substrate for autoassociative memory networks. We review evidence for the radical (but classic) view that a unique transformation of incoming cortical signals by the dentate gyrus and the subsequent faithful transfer of the resulting code by the mossy fibers are absolutely critical for the appropriate association of memory items by CA3 and, in general, for hippocampal function. In particular, at the gate of the hippocampal formation, the dentate gyrus possesses a set of unusual properties, which selectively evolved for the task of code transformation between cortical afferents and the hippocampus. These evolutionarily conserved anatomical features enable the dentate gyrus to translate the noisy signal of the upstream cortical areas into the sparse and specific code of hippocampal formation, which is indispensable for the efficient storage and recall of multiple, multidimensional memory items. To achieve this goal the mossy fiber pathway maximally utilizes the opportunity to differentially regulate its postsynaptic partners. Selective innervation of CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons by distinct terminal types creates a favorable condition to differentially regulate the short-term and long-term plasticity and the motility of various mossy terminal types. The utility of this highly dynamic system appears to be the frequency-dependent fine-tuning the excitation and inhibition evoked by the large and the small mossy terminals respectively. This will determine exactly which CA3 cell population is active and induces permanent modification in the autoassociational network of the CA3 region.},

  abstract    = {The reduced P3 is one of the most robust deficits involved in schizophrenia. Previous research with catecholaminergic agonists or releasers such as amphetamines have used doses too small to adequately demonstrate an effect on P3. In this study, we gave 0.45 mg/kg dexamphetamine to healthy volunteers (final n = 18) using both auditory and visual three-stimulus P3 procedures. Dexamphetamine significantly reduced P3 amplitudes to auditory target, rare non-target and standard stimulus amplitudes. The reduction in auditory P3 induced by dexamphetamine was proportional across stimulus types to placebo P3 values. There were no effects of dexamphetamine on visual P3. We demonstrate a reduced auditory P3 similar to that seen in schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. This possibly reflects a common pathology which is hypothesized within the P3 literature to be related to attention and working memory. Differences between auditory and visual P3 modulation may be related to regional variations in catecholamine or specifically dopamine receptor densities. One specific auditory P3 generator is the superior temporal cortex, an area with dopamine D(2) receptor enriched bands. This is contrasted with visual specific generators, such as the inferior temporal cortex and superior parietal cortex, which do not have these enriched bands.},

  abstract    = {Within neural networks, synchronization of activity is dependent upon the synaptic connectivity of embedded microcircuits and the intrinsic membrane properties of their constituent neurons. Synaptic integration, dendritic Ca(2+) signaling, and non-linear interactions are crucial cellular attributes that dictate single neuron computation, but their roles promoting synchrony and the generation of network oscillations are not well understood, especially within the context of a defined behavior. In this regard, the lamprey spinal central pattern generator (CPG) stands out as a well-characterized, conserved vertebrate model of a neural network (Smith et al., 2013a), which produces synchronized oscillations in which neural elements from the systems to cellular level that control rhythmic locomotion have been determined. We review the current evidence for the synaptic basis of oscillation generation with a particular emphasis on the linkage between synaptic communication and its cellular coupling to membrane processes that control oscillatory behavior of neurons within the locomotor network. We seek to relate dendritic function found in many vertebrate systems to the accessible lamprey central nervous system in which the relationship between neural network activity and behavior is well understood. This enables us to address how Ca(2+) signaling in spinal neuron dendrites orchestrate oscillations that drive network behavior.},

  abstract    = {This review covers recent developments in the cellular neurophysiology of retrograde signaling in the mammalian central nervous system. Normally at a chemical synapse a neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic element and diffuses to the postsynaptic element, where it binds to and activates receptors. In retrograde signaling a diffusible messenger is liberated from the postsynaptic element, and travels "backwards" across the synaptic cleft, where it activates receptors on the presynaptic cell. Receptors for retrograde messengers are usually located on or near the presynaptic nerve terminals, and their activation causes an alteration in synaptic transmitter release. Although often considered in the context of long-term synaptic plasticity, retrograde messengers have numerous roles on the short-term regulation of synaptic transmission. The focus of this review will be on a group of molecules from different chemical classes that appear to act as retrograde messengers. The evidence supporting their candidacy as retrograde messengers is considered and evaluated. Endocannabinoids have recently emerged as one of the most thoroughly investigated, and widely accepted, classes of retrograde messenger in the brain. The study of the endocannabinoids can therefore serve as a model for the investigation of other putative messengers, and most attention is devoted to a discussion of systems that use these new messenger molecules.},

  abstract    = {Activation of muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors (mAChRs) powerfully affects many neuronal properties as well as numerous cognitive behaviors. Small neuronal circuits constitute an intermediate level of organization between neurons and behaviors, and mAChRs affect interactions among cells that compose these circuits. Circuit activity is often assessed by extracellular recordings of the local field potentials (LFPs), which are analogous to in vivo EEGs, generated by coordinated neuronal interactions. Coherent forms of physiologically relevant circuit activity manifest themselves as rhythmic oscillations in the LFPs. Frequencies of rhythmic oscillations that are most closely associated with animal behavior are in the range of 4-80 Hz, which is subdivided into theta (4-14 Hz), beta (15-29 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) bands. Activation of mAChRs triggers rhythmic oscillations in these bands in the hippocampus and neocortex. Inhibitory responses mediated by GABAergic interneurons constitute a prominent feature of these oscillations, and indeed, appear to be their major underlying factor in many cases. An important issue is which interneurons are involved in rhythm generation. Besides affecting cellular and network properties directly, mAChRs can cause the mobilization of endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids, eCBs) that, by acting on the principal cannabinoid receptor of the brain, CB1R, regulate the release of certain neurotransmitters, including GABA. CB1Rs are heavily expressed on only a subset of interneurons and, at lower density, on glutamatergic neurons. Exogenous cannabinoids typically disrupt oscillations in the theta (θ) and gamma (γ) ranges, which probably contributes to the behavioral effects of these drugs. It is important to understand how neuronal circuit activity is affected by mAChR-driven eCBs, as this information will provide deeper insight into the actions of ACh itself, as well as into the effects of eCBs and exogenous cannabinoids in animal behavior. After covering some basic aspects of the mAChR system, this review will focus on recent findings concerning the mechanisms and circuitry that generate θ and γ rhythms in hippocampus and neocortex. The ability of optogenetic methods to probe the many roles of ACh in rhythm generation is highlighted.},

  abstract    = {There is growing evidence to link cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive interneurons and anxiety disorders. Despite this, little is known about the physiology and pharmacology of synaptic interactions between CCK-positive interneurons. This study aims to investigate the local circuit connections among CCK-positive Schaffer collateral associated (SCA) interneurons in stratum radiatum (SR) and their modulatory interactions using paired whole cell recordings combined with biocytin and double immunofluorescence labeling in slices of rat hippocampus. The cell bodies of SCA interneurons were located in SR, and their sparsely spiny dendrites projected toward s. pyramidale (SP) and along SR. Their axons innervated SR, SP, and s. oriens (SO) with predominant ramification in SR. These cells were immunopositive for CCK and immunonegative for parvalbumin (PV). SCA interneurons often displayed an accommodating firing pattern with or without a "sag" in response to hyperpolarizing current injection. Pairs of these cells exhibited electrical coupling and reciprocal chemical connections in which inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) displayed powerful frequency-dependent facilitation and augmentation. The synaptic connections were modulated by the endogenous cannabinoid receptor (CB) agonist, anandamide and by depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), both of which reduced the amplitude of unitary IPSPs to 50\% of control and increased the number of apparent failures of transmission. These effects were blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM-251. I suggest that synaptic facilitation between CCK-positive SCA interneurons may modify the onset of CB1 receptor-mediated regulation of inhibition, thereby affecting spike timing, and that this process could influence the expression of anxiety.},

  abstract    = {One of the critical factors in determining network behavior of neurons is the influence of local circuit connections among interneurons. The short-term synaptic plasticity and the subtype of presynaptic calcium channels used at local circuit connections of inhibitory interneurons in CA1 were investigated using dual whole-cell recordings combined with biocytin and double immunofluorescence labeling in acute slices of P18- to 21-day-old rat stratum radiatum (SR) and stratum lacunosum molecular (SLM). Two forms of temporally distinct synaptic facilitation were observed among interneuron connections involving presynaptic cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive cells in SR, frequency-dependent facilitation, and a delayed onset of release (45-80 ms) with subsequent facilitation (DORF). Inhibition at both these synapses was under tonic cannabinoid-type 1 (CB1) receptor activity. DORF synapses did not display conventional release-dependent properties; however, blocking CB1 receptors with antagonist AM-251 (10 μM) altered the synaptic transmission to frequency-dependent depression with a fast onset of release (2-4 ms). Presynaptic CCK-negative interneurons in SLM elicited inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) insensitive to CB1 receptor pharmacology displayed frequency-dependent depression. Release of GABA at facilitating synapses was solely mediated via N-type presynaptic calcium channels, whereas depressing synapses utilized P/Q-type channels. These data reveal two distinct models of neurotransmitter release patterns among interneuron circuits that correlate with the subtype of presynaptic calcium channel. These data suggest that endocannabinoids act via CB1 receptors to selectively modulate N-type calcium channels to alter signal transmission.},

However, extracellular fields feed back onto the electric potential across the neuronal membrane via ephaptic coupling, independent of synapses. The extent to which such ephaptic coupling alters the functioning of neurons under physiological conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we stimulated and recorded from rat cortical pyramidal neurons in slices with a 12-electrode setup. We found that extracellular fields induced ephaptically mediated changes in the somatic membrane potential that were less than 0.5 mV under subthreshold conditions. Despite their small size, these fields could strongly entrain action potentials, particularly for slow (<8 Hz) fluctuations of the extracellular field. Finally, we simultaneously measured from up to four patched neurons located proximally to each other. Our findings indicate that endogenous brain activity can causally affect neural function through field effects under physiological conditions.},

  abstract    = {Disturbed functional connectivity is assumed to underlie neurocognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. As neurocognitive deficits are already present in the high-risk state, identification of the neural networks involved in this core feature of schizophrenia is essential to our understanding of the disorder. Resting-state studies enable such investigations, while at the same time avoiding the known confounder of impaired task performance in patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate EEG resting-state connectivity in high-risk individuals (HR) compared to first episode patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and to healthy controls (HC), and its association with cognitive deficits.64-channel resting-state EEG recordings (eyes closed) were obtained for 28 HR, 19 stable SZ, and 23 HC, matched for age, education, and parental education. The imaginary coherence-based multivariate interaction measure (MIM) was used as a measure of connectivity across 80 cortical regions and six frequency bands. Mean connectivity at each region was compared across groups using the non-parametric randomization approach. Additionally, the network-based statistic was applied to identify affected networks in patients.SZ displayed increased theta-band resting-state MIM connectivity across midline, sensorimotor, orbitofrontal regions and the left temporoparietal junction. HR displayed intermediate theta-band connectivity patterns that did not differ from either SZ or HC. Mean theta-band connectivity within the above network partially mediated verbal memory deficits in SZ and HR.Aberrant theta-band connectivity may represent a trait characteristic of schizophrenia associated with neurocognitive deficits. As such, it might constitute a promising target for novel treatment applications.},

Despite a number of studies characterizing ETCs, little is known about how their morphological and functional properties correspond to each other. Here we determined the active and passive electrical properties of ETCs using in vitro whole-cell recordings, and correlated them with their dendritic arborization patterns. Principal component followed by cluster analysis revealed two distinct subpopulations of ETCs based on their electrophysiological properties. Eight out of 12 measured physiological parameters exhibited significant difference between the two subpopulations, including the membrane time constant, amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization, variance in the interspike interval distribution and subthreshold resonance. Cluster analysis of the morphological properties of the cells also revealed two subpopulations, the most prominent dissimilarity between the groups being the presence or absence of secondary, basal dendrites. Finally, clustering the cells taking all measured properties into account also indicated the presence of two subpopulations that mapped in an almost perfect one-to-one fashion to both the physiologically and the morphologically derived groups. Our results demonstrate that a number of functional and structural properties of ETCs are highly predictive of one another. However, cells within each subpopulation exhibit pronounced variability, suggesting a large degree of specialization evolved to fulfil specific functional requirements in olfactory information processing.},

Incomplete characterization of thalamic connectivity in schizophrenia limits our understanding of its relationship to symptoms and to diagnoses with shared clinical presentation, such as bipolar illness, which may exist on a spectrum. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we characterized thalamic connectivity in 90 schizophrenia patients versus 90 matched controls via: (1) Subject-specific anatomically defined thalamic seeds; (2) anatomical and data-driven clustering to assay within-thalamus dysconnectivity; and (3) machine learning to classify diagnostic membership via thalamic connectivity for schizophrenia and for 47 bipolar patients and 47 matched controls. Schizophrenia analyses revealed functionally related disturbances: Thalamic over-connectivity with bilateral sensory-motor cortices, which predicted symptoms, but thalamic under-connectivity with prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar regions relative to controls, possibly reflective of sensory gating and top-down control disturbances. Clustering revealed that this dysconnectivity was prominent for thalamic nuclei densely connected with the prefrontal cortex. Classification and cross-diagnostic results suggest that thalamic dysconnectivity may be a neural marker for disturbances across diagnoses. Present findings, using one of the largest schizophrenia and bipolar neuroimaging samples to date, inform basic understanding of large-scale thalamo-cortical systems and provide vital clues about the complex nature of its disturbances in severe mental illness.},

  abstract    = {Neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar illness alter the structure and function of distributed neural networks. Functional neuroimaging tools have evolved sufficiently to reliably detect system-level disturbances in neural networks. This review focuses on recent findings in schizophrenia and bipolar illness using resting-state neuroimaging, an advantageous approach for biomarker development given its ease of data collection and lack of task-based confounds. These benefits notwithstanding, neuroimaging does not yet allow the evaluation of individual neurons within local circuits, where pharmacological treatments ultimately exert their effects. This limitation constitutes an important obstacle in translating findings from animal research to humans and from healthy humans to patient populations. Integrating new neuroscientific tools may help to bridge some of these gaps. We specifically discuss two complementary approaches. The first is pharmacological manipulations in healthy volunteers, which transiently mimic some cardinal features of psychiatric conditions. We specifically focus on recent neuroimaging studies using the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, to probe glutamate synaptic dysfunction associated with schizophrenia. Second, we discuss the combination of human pharmacological imaging with biophysically informed computational models developed to guide the interpretation of functional imaging studies and to inform the development of pathophysiologic hypotheses. To illustrate this approach, we review clinical investigations in addition to recent findings of how computational modeling has guided inferences drawn from our studies involving ketamine administration to healthy subjects. Thus, this review asserts that linking experimental studies in humans with computational models will advance to effort to bridge cellular, systems, and clinical neuroscience approaches to psychiatric disorders.},

Studies on this topic have been limited to processes in local circuits; however, cognition involves large-scale brain systems with multiple interacting regions. A prominent feature of the human brain's global architecture is the anticorrelation of default-mode vs. task-positive systems. Here, we show that administration of an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, disrupted the reciprocal relationship between these systems in terms of task-dependent activation and connectivity during performance of delayed working memory. Furthermore, the degree of this disruption predicted task performance and transiently evoked symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia. We offer a parsimonious hypothesis for this disruption via biophysically realistic computational modeling, namely cortical disinhibition. Together, the present findings establish links between glutamate's role in the organization of large-scale anticorrelated neural systems, cognition, and symptoms associated with schizophrenia in humans.},

  abstract    = {A diversity of GABAergic cell types exist within each brain area, and each cell type is thought to play a unique role in the modulation of principal cell output. Basket cells, whose axon terminals surround principal cell somata and proximal dendrites, have a privileged and influential position for regulating the firing of principal cells. This review explores the dichotomy of the two basket cell classes, cholecystokinin- (CCK) and parvalbumin (PV)-containing basket cells, beginning with differences at the level of the individual cell and subsequently focusing on two ways in which this intrinsic dichotomy is enhanced by extrinsic factors. Neuromodulatory influences, exemplified by the effects of the peptide CCK, dynamically enhance the differential functions of the two cell types. Specifications at the level of the postsynaptic principal cell, including input-specific differences in chloride handling and differences in long-range projection patterns of the principal cell targets, also enhance the distinct network function of basket cells. In this review, new findings will be highlighted concerning the roles of neuromodulatory control and postsynaptic long-range projection pattern in the definition of basket cell function.},

  abstract    = {The symptoms of schizophrenia involve profound dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). PFC networks create our "mental sketch pad", and PFC dysfunction contributes to symptoms such as cognitive deficits, thought disorder, delusions and hallucinations. Neuropathological studies of schizophrenia have shown marked loss of dendritic spines in deep layer III, the sublayer where PFC microcircuits reside. The microcircuits consist of recurrent excitatory pyramidal cell networks that interconnect on spines, and excite each other via NMDA receptor signaling. The pyramidal cell persistent firing is sculpted by lateral inhibition from GABAergic basket and chandelier cells, thus creating tuned, persistent firing needed for accurate representational knowledge (i.e., working memory). The strength of pyramidal cell network connections is markedly and flexibly altered by intracellular signaling pathways in dendritic spines, a process called dynamic network connectivity (DNC). DNC proteins such as HCN channels are concentrated on dendritic spines in deep layer III. Under optimal conditions, network inputs to pyramidal cells are strengthened by noradrenergic alpha-2A inhibition of cAMP-HCN channel signaling, and sculpted by dopamine D1-cAMP-HCN channel weakening of inappropriate inputs. However, with stress exposure, high levels of cAMP-HCN channel signaling produces a collapse in network firing. With chronic stress exposure, spines reduce in size and are lost, and this process involves increased PKC signaling. Importantly, molecules that normally strengthen PFC networks connections and/or reverse the stress response, are often genetically altered in schizophrenia. As exposure to stress is a key factor in the precipitation of schizophrenic symptoms, these dysregulated signaling pathways in deep layer III may interact with already vulnerable circuitry to cause spine loss and the descent into illness.},

  abstract    = {Patricia S. Goldman-Rakic (1937-2003) transformed the study of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the neural basis of mental representation, the basic building block of abstract thought. Her pioneering research first identified the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) region essential for spatial working memory, and the extensive circuits of spatial cognition. She discovered the cellular basis of working memory, illuminating the dlPFC microcircuitry underlying spatially tuned, persistent firing, whereby precise information can be held "in mind": persistent firing arises from recurrent excitation within glutamatergic pyramidal cell circuits in deep layer III, while tuning arises from GABAergic lateral inhibition. She was the first to discover that dopamine is essential for dlPFC function, particularly through D1 receptor actions. She applied a host of technical approaches, providing a new paradigm for scientific inquiry. Goldman-Rakic's work has allowed the perplexing complexities of mental illness to begun to be understood at the cellular level, including atrophy of the dlPFC microcircuits subserving mental representation. She correctly predicted that impairments in dlPFC working memory activity would contribute to thought disorder, a cardinal symptom of schizophrenia. Ten years following her death, we look back to see how she inspired an entire field, fundamentally changing our view of cognition and cognitive disorders.},

This newly discovered form of neuroplasticity provides great flexibility in mental state, but also confers vulnerability and limits mental capacity. A remarkable number of genetic and/or environmental insults to DNC signaling cascades are associated with cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia and age-related cognitive decline.

Working memory arises from recurrent excitation within layer III PFC pyramidal cell NMDA circuits, which are afflicted in aging and schizophrenia. Neuromodulators rapidly and flexibly alter the efficacy of these synaptic connections, while leaving the synaptic architecture unchanged, a process called dynamic network connectivity (DNC). Increases in calcium-cAMP signaling open ion channels in long, thin spines, gating network connections. Inhibition of calcium-cAMP signaling by stimulating α2A-adrenoceptors on spines strengthens synaptic efficacy and increases network firing, whereas optimal stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors sculpts network inputs to refine mental representation. Generalized increases in calcium-cAMP signaling during fatigue or stress disengage dlPFC recurrent circuits, reduce firing and impair top-down cognition. Impaired DNC regulation contributes to age-related cognitive decline, while genetic insults to DNC proteins are commonly linked to schizophrenia.},

Initially, studies in animals using a number of neurochemical, biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral paradigms indicated that clozapine was markedly different from various typical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine. Subsequently, clinical studies have shown that clozapine is effective in ameliorating the core symptoms, as well as the negative symptoms, in schizophrenia. However, clozapine has a much lower propensity for inducing neurological side effects after acute or repeated administration compared to various typical neuroleptics. Furthermore, clozapine is therapeutically effective in treating about 30\% of schizophrenic patients who are resistant to standard antipsychotic drugs. Based on the above information, clozapine has been designated an atypical antipsychotic drug. However, at this time, it is not entirely clear why clozapine is such a unique antipsychotic drug. To date, there has not been a comprehensive review regarding clozapine's pharmacological profile. Therefore, we will review clozapine's profile in the following areas: 1) affinity for neurotransmitter receptors in the brain; 2) electrophysiology (in vivo, single-cell recording and iontophoresis; in vitro studies); 3) in vivo microdialysis and voltammetry; 4) monoamine turnover or metabolism; 5) intermediate early gene expression; 6) positron emission tomography studies; and 7) molecular biological studies. We will also compare and contrast clozapine's acute and chronic effects, and discuss the merits of various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain clozapine's unique profile.},

  abstract    = {The A-type potassium current has been implicated in the regulation of several physiological processes. Here, we explore a role for the A-type potassium current in regulating the release of calcium through inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) that reside on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. To do this, we constructed morphologically realistic, conductance-based models equipped with kinetic schemes that govern several calcium signalling modules and pathways, and constrained the distributions and properties of constitutive components by experimental measurements from these neurons. Employing these models, we establish a bell-shaped dependence of calcium release through InsP3Rs on the density of A-type potassium channels, during the propagation of an intraneuronal calcium wave initiated through established protocols. Exploring the sensitivities of calcium wave initiation and propagation to several underlying parameters, we found that ER calcium release critically depends on dendritic diameter and that wave initiation occurred at branch points as a consequence of a high surface area to volume ratio of oblique dendrites. Furthermore, analogous to the role of A-type potassium channels in regulating spike latency, we found that an increase in the density of A-type potassium channels led to increases in the latency and the temporal spread of a propagating calcium wave. Next, we incorporated kinetic models for the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signalling components and a calcium-controlled plasticity rule into our model and demonstrate that the presence of mGluRs induced a leftward shift in a Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro-like synaptic plasticity profile. Finally, we show that the A-type potassium current could regulate the relative contribution of ER calcium to synaptic plasticity induced either through 900 pulses of various stimulus frequencies or through theta burst stimulation. Our results establish a novel form of interaction between active dendrites and the ER membrane, uncovering a powerful mechanism that could regulate biophysical/biochemical signal integration and steer the spatiotemporal spread of signalling microdomains through changes in dendritic excitability.},

We compared the neural response to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in healthy volunteers in whom the drug did or did not induce acute psychotic symptoms. Method In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pseudorandomized design, 21 healthy men with minimal experience of cannabis were given either 10 mg THC or placebo, orally. Behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures were then recorded whilst they performed a go/no-go task.The sample was subdivided on the basis of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive score following administration of THC into transiently psychotic (TP; n = 11) and non-psychotic (NP; n = 10) groups. During the THC condition, TP subjects made more frequent inhibition errors than the NP group and showed differential activation relative to the NP group in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left and right middle temporal gyri and in the right cerebellum. In these regions, THC had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the two groups. The TP group also showed less activation than the NP group in the right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum, independent of the effects of THC.In this first demonstration of inter-subject variability in sensitivity to the psychotogenic effects of THC, we found that the presence of acute psychotic symptoms was associated with a differential effect of THC on activation in the ventral and medial temporal cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that these regions mediate the effects of the drug on psychotic symptoms.},

  abstract    = {The haemodynamic responses to neural activity that underlie the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain are often assumed to be driven by energy use, particularly in presynaptic terminals or glia. However, recent work has suggested that most brain energy is used to power postsynaptic currents and action potentials rather than presynaptic or glial activity and, furthermore, that haemodynamic responses are driven by neurotransmitter-related signalling and not directly by the local energy needs of the brain. A firm understanding of the BOLD response will require investigation to be focussed on the neural signalling mechanisms controlling blood flow rather than on the locus of energy use.},

Here we review our current understanding of the interactions between these processes, with a focus on how each construct encompasses a variety of dissociable phenomena. Attention facilitates target processing during both perceptual and postperceptual stages of processing, and functionally dissociated processes have been implicated in the maintenance of different kinds of information in working memory. Thus, although it is clear that these processes are closely intertwined, the nature of these interactions depends upon the specific variety of attention or working memory that is considered.},

We employed five trials of interest: first presentations, exact repetitions, lures in which the same objects were repeated in different locations (spatial lures), lures in which the same objects were presented in a different sequential order (sequential lures), and lures in which both the spatial location and sequence were changed (both lures). We found no evidence for spatial or sequential specialization in the hippocampal subfields, consistent with the hypothesis that the dentate gyrus acts as a universal pattern separator. Likewise, we did not observe specialization for the perirhinal or parahippocampal cortices for spatial or sequential information, though both regions show evidence for associative processing in this task.},

This study addressed the effects of exposure to cannabis with up to 69.4mg Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) recorded during a visual selective attention task.Twenty-four participants smoked cannabis cigarettes with four doses of THC on four test days in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Two hours after THC exposure the participants performed a visual selective attention task and concomitant ERPs were recorded.Accuracy decreased linearly and reaction times increased linearly with THC dose. However, performance measures and most of the ERP components related specifically to selective attention did not show significant dose effects. Only in relatively light cannabis users the Occipital Selection Negativity decreased linearly with dose. Furthermore, ERP components reflecting perceptual processing, as well as the P300 component, decreased in amplitude after THC exposure. Only the former effect showed a linear dose-response relation.The decrements in performance and ERP amplitudes induced by exposure to cannabis with high THC content resulted from a non-selective decrease in attentional or processing resources.Performance requiring attentional resources, such as vehicle control, may be compromised several hours after smoking cannabis cigarettes containing high doses of THC, as presently available in Europe and Northern America.},

  abstract    = {It is well known that theta rhythms (3-8 Hz) are the fingerprint of hippocampus, and that neural activity accompanying encoding of words differs according to whether the items are later remembered or forgotten ["subsequent memory effect" (SME)]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that temporal synchronization of theta rhythms among hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex is related to immediate memorization of repeated words. To address this issue, intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded in five subjects with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), under presurgical monitoring routine. During the recording of the intracerebral EEG activity, the subjects performed a computerized version of Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT), a popular test for the clinical evaluation of the immediate and delayed memory. They heard the same list of 15 common words for five times. Each time, immediately after listening the list, the subjects were required to repeat as many words as they could recall. Spectral coherence of the intracerebral EEG activity was computed in order to assess the temporal synchronization of the theta (about 3-8 Hz) rhythms among hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal-occipital neocortex. We found that theta coherence values between amygdala and hippocampus, and between hippocampus and occipital-temporal cortex, were higher in amplitude during successful than unsuccessful immediate recall. A control analysis showed that this was true also for a gamma band (40-45 Hz). Furthermore, these theta and gamma effects were not observed in an additional (control) subject with drug-resistant TLE and a wide lesion to hippocampus. In conclusion, a successful immediate recall to the RAVLT was associated to the enhancement of temporal synchronization of the theta (gamma) rhythms within a cerebral network including hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal-occipital neocortex.},

  abstract    = {Neocortical GABA-containing interneurons form complex functional networks responsible for feedforward and feedback inhibition and for the generation of cortical oscillations associated with several behavioural functions. We previously reported that fast-spiking (FS), but not low-threshold-spiking (LTS), neocortical interneurons from rats generate a fast and precise self-inhibition mediated by inhibitory autaptic transmission. Here we show that LTS cells possess a different form of self-inhibition. LTS, but not FS, interneurons undergo a prominent hyperpolarization mediated by an increased K+-channel conductance. This self-induced inhibition lasts for many minutes, is dependent on an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and is blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251, indicating that it is mediated by the autocrine release of endogenous cannabinoids. Endocannabinoid-mediated slow self-inhibition represents a powerful and long-lasting mechanism that alters the intrinsic excitability of LTS neurons, which selectively target the major site of excitatory connections onto pyramidal neurons; that is, their dendrites. Thus, modulation of LTS networks after their sustained firing will lead to long-lasting changes of glutamate-mediated synaptic strength in pyramidal neurons, with consequences during normal and pathophysiological cortical network activities.},

  abstract    = {Locally projecting GABAergic interneurons are the major providers of inhibition in the neocortex and play a crucial role in several brain functions. Neocortical interneurons are connected via electrical and chemical synapses that may be crucial in modulating complex network oscillations. We investigated the properties of spontaneous and evoked IPSCs in two morphologically and physiologically identified interneuron subtypes, the fast-spiking (FS) and low threshold-spiking (LTS) cells in layer V of rodent sensorimotor cortex. We found that IPSCs recorded in FS cells were several orders of magnitude more frequent, larger in amplitude, and had faster kinetics than IPSCs recorded in LTS cells. GABA(A) receptor alpha- and beta-subunit selective modulators, zolpidem and loreclezole, had different effects on IPSCs in FS and LTS interneurons, suggesting differential expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit subtypes. These pharmacological data indicated that the alpha1 subunit subtype is poorly expressed by LTS cells but makes a large contribution to GABA(A) receptors on FS cells. This was confirmed by experiments performed in genetically modified mice in which the alpha1 subunit had been made insensitive to benzodiazepine-like agonists. These results suggest that differences in IPSC waveform are likely attributable to distinctive expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits in FS and LTS cells. The particular properties of GABAergic input on different interneuronal subtypes might have important consequences for generation and pacing of cortical rhythms underlying several brain functions. Moreover, selective pharmacological manipulation of distinct inhibitory circuits might allow regulation of pyramidal cell activities under specific physiological and pathophysiological conditions.},

Glutamate projection neurons connect these limbic cortical regions to each other, as well as to the terminal fields of the striatal/accumbens dopamine neurons. Subsets of these glutamate projection neurons, and of the GABA interneurons in cortex, contain the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK). In an effort to study the limbic cortical glutamate projection neurons and GABA interneurons in schizophrenia, we have measured CCK mRNA with in situ hybridization histochemistry in postmortem samples of dorsolateral (DL)PFC, ACC and ERC of seven schizophrenics, nine non-psychotic suicides and seven normal controls. CCK mRNA is decreased in ERC (especially layers iii vi) and subiculum in schizophrenics relative to controls. Cellular analysis indicates that there is a decrease in density of CCK mRNA in labelled neurons. In so far as ERC CCK mRNA is not reduced in rats treated chronically with haloperidol, this decrease in schizophrenics does not appear to be related to neuroleptic treatment. In contrast, in DLPFC, where schizophrenics do not differ from normals, the suicide victims have elevated CCK mRNA (especially in layers v and vi), and increased cellular density of CCK mRNA, relative to both normals and schizophrenics. These results lend further support for the involvement of ERC and hippocampus in schizophrenia, suggesting that neurons that utilize CCK may be particularly important. Similarly, an increase in CCK mRNA levels in the PFC of suicides adds to a growing body of evidence implicating this structure in this pathological state. In so far as CCK is co-localized with GABA or glutamate in cortical neurons, both of these neuronal populations need to be studied further in schizophrenia and suicide.},

The aim of the current study was to identify these sources, with concurrent EEG and fMRI methodology. Twenty healthy male volunteers were tested with identical P50 suppression paradigms in two separate sessions: an EEG setting, and an EEG concurrent with fMRI setting. The stimuli in the P50 paradigm consisted of weak electrical stimulation of the left median nerve. The stimuli were presented in pairs with either 500 ms or 1000 ms interstimulus intervals (ISI). No difference was found between the EEG setting and the concurrent EEG and fMRI setting. P50 suppression was, in both settings, found only in the 500 ms trials, not in the 1000 ms trials. EEG-dipole modeling resulted in 4 sources located in the medial frontal gyrus, the insula, the hippocampus, and primary somatosensory cortex. These sources corresponded to significant fMRI clusters located in the medial frontal gyrus, the insula, the claustrum, and the hippocampus. Activity in the hippocampus and the claustrum was higher in the trials with suppression, suggesting that these brain areas are involved in the inhibitory processes of P50 suppression. The opposite was found for activity in the medial frontal gyrus and the insula, suggesting that these brain areas are involved in the generation of the P50 amplitude. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that P50 suppression can be reliably assessed inside an MRI scanner.},

  abstract    = {Cholecystokinin (CCK) and its receptor CCK-2R have been shown to promote emotional responsivity and behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants in the rat. An animal model has been developed based on locomotor response to a novel inescapable environment. Animals exhibiting consistent differences in locomotor response to novelty have been termed as high and low responder rats (HR and LR, respectively). This paradigm is deemed to model sensation-seeking, a personality trait closely associated with substance abuse. The present study provides genetic and pharmacological evidence that the CCK-ergic system modulates this behavior. Distinctive patterns of CCK-related gene expression in HR and LR animals occurred beyond the mesolimbic pathways. CCK gene expression was higher in hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, but lower in the ventral tegmental area of HR relative to LR rats. Levels of CCK-2R mRNA were more elevated in LR animals in some areas of the forebrain such as the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus. Additionally, CCK-2R blockade with the antagonist LY225.910 (0.5 mg/kg) removed phenotype differences in sustained exploration of novel stimuli (i.e., a novel-object) in HR and LR rats exposed to an enriched open-field test series. Finally, CCK-2R blockade also altered M(2) and 5-HT(7) receptor gene expression in the mediodorsal thalamus (a strategic structure for corticothalamic trafficking) in a phenotype-dependent manner. Taken together, the findings reported here suggest that distinct CCK-ergic function may contribute to promoting individual differences in novelty-seeking behavior.},

  abstract    = {How is the vast brain communication system organized? A structural model relates connections to laminar differences between linked areas. The model is based on the principle of systematic structural variation in the cortex, extending from the simplest limbic cortices to eulaminate areas with elaborate lamination. The model accounts for laminar patterns and for the strength and topography of connections between nearby or distant cortices and subcortical structures, exemplified quantitatively for the principal and special prefrontal connections. Widespread connections of limbic areas and focal connections of eulaminate areas yield a broad range of circuit patterns for diverse functions. These diverse pathways innervate excitatory and functionally distinct inhibitory neurons, providing the basis for differential recruitment of areas for flexible behavior. Systematic structural variation likely emerges by timing differences in the development of distinct areas and has important implications for altered connections in diseases of developmental origin.},

One possibility is that THC stimulates dopamine (DA) release in the striatum. In this study we tested whether IV THC led to an increase in striatal DA release compared to placebo. We also investigated whether DA release and positive psychotic symptoms were related. Eleven healthy male volunteers completed two 123I-iodobenzamide ([123I]IBZM) single photon emission tomography (SPET) sessions and received IV THC (2.5 mg) or placebo in a randomized counterbalanced order, under double-blind conditions. Analysable data were obtained from nine participants. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was used to rate psychotomimetic effects. Striatal binding index values were calculated using the occipital cortex as a reference region. Both the PANSS positive and general symptoms increased significantly at 30 min following IV THC. There were no significant differences in binding index in the caudate or putamen under THC compared to placebo conditions. Positive psychotic symptoms and DA release were unrelated. THC did not lead to a significant increase in DA release even though the dose was sufficient for participants to have psychotic symptoms. These findings do not support a central role for striatal DA in THC-elicited psychosis.},

EEG was recorded from 21 sites during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed. Wave-shape coherence was calculated for 8 intrahemispheric electrode pairs (4 in each hemisphere), and 8 interhemispheric electrode pairs, within each of the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands.At shorter inter-electrode distances, ADHD children had elevated intrahemispheric coherences in the theta band and reduced lateral differences in the theta and alpha bands. At longer inter-electrode distances, ADHD children had lower intrahemispheric alpha coherences than controls. Frontally, ADHD children had interhemispheric coherences elevated in the delta and theta bands, and reduced in the alpha band. An alpha coherence reduction in temporal regions, and a theta coherence enhancement in central/parietal/occipital regions, were also apparent. ADHDcom had greater intrahemispheric theta and beta coherences than ADHDin. Frontally, ADHDcom had higher levels of interhemispheric coherences than ADHDin for the delta and theta bands. In central/parietal/occipital regions, beta coherences were elevated in ADHDcom.EEG coherences suggest reduced cortical differentiation and specialisation in ADHD, particularly in cortico-cortical circuits involving theta activity. Generally, ADHDcom children displayed greater anomalies than ADHDin children.},

  abstract    = {Cortical neuronal network operations depend critically on the recruitment of GABAergic interneurons and the properties of their inhibitory output signals. Recent evidence indicates a marked difference in the signalling properties of two major types of perisomatic inhibitory interneurons, the parvalbumin- and the cholecystokinin-containing basket cells. Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells are rapidly recruited by excitatory synaptic inputs, generate high-frequency trains of action potentials, discharge single action potentials phase-locked to fast network oscillations and provide fast, stable and timed inhibitory output onto their target cells. In contrast, cholecystokinin-containing basket cells are recruited in a less reliable manner, discharge at moderate frequencies with single action potentials weakly coupled to the phases of fast network oscillations and generate an asynchronous, fluctuating and less timed inhibitory output. These signalling modes are based on cell type-dependent differences in the functional and plastic properties of excitatory input synapses, integrative qualities and in the kinetics and dynamics of inhibitory output synapses. Thus, the two perisomatic inhibitory interneuron types operate with different speed and precision and may therefore contribute differently to the operations of neuronal networks.},

  abstract    = {Brain oscillations have gained tremendous importance in neuroscience during recent decades as functional building blocks of sensory-cognitive processes. Research also shows that event-related oscillations (EROs) in "alpha," "beta," "gamma," "delta," and "theta" frequency windows are highly modified in pathological brains, especially in patients with cognitive impairment. The strategies and methods applied in the present report reflect the innate organization of the brain: "the whole brain work." The present paper is an account of methods such as evoked/event-related spectra, evoked/ERDs, coherence analysis, and phase-locking. The report does not aim to cover all strategies related to the systems theory applied in brain research literature. However, the essential methods and concepts are applied in several examples from Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BD), and such examples lead to fundamental statements in the search for neurophysiological biomarkers in cognitive impairment. An overview of the results clearly demonstrates that it is obligatory to apply the method of oscillations in multiple electroencephalogram frequency windows in search of functional biomarkers and to detect the effects of drug applications. Again, according to the summary of results in AD patients and BD patients, multiple oscillations and selectively distributed recordings must be analyzed and should include multiple locations. Selective connectivity between selectively distributed neural networks has to be computed by means of spatial coherence. Therefore, by designing a strategy for diagnostics, the differential diagnostics, and application of (preventive) drugs, neurophysiological information should be analyzed within a framework including multiple methods and multiple frequency bands. The application of drugs/neurotransmitters gains a new impact with the analysis of oscillations and coherences. A more clear and differentiated analysis of drug effects can be attained in comparison to the application of the conventional wide-band evoked potential and event-related potential applications.},

  abstract    = {While the hippocampus makes unique contributions to memory, it has also long been associated with sensorimotor processes, i.e. innate processes involving control of motor responses to sensory stimuli. Moreover, hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, primarily characterized by non-mnemonic deficits in the processing of and responding to sensory information. This review is concerned with the hippocampal modulation of three sensorimotor processes in rats-locomotor activity, prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, and the startle reflex itself-whose alterations are related to human psychosis or anxiety disorders. Its main purpose is to present and discuss the picture emerging from studies examining the effects of pharmacological manipulations of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus by local drug microinfusions. While a role of the hippocampus in regulating locomotor activity, PPI, and startle reactivity has also been suggested based on the effects of hippocampal lesions, the microinfusion studies have revealed additional important details of this role and suggest modifications of notions based on lesion studies. In summary, the microinfusion studies corroborate that hippocampal mechanisms can directly influence locomotor activity, PPI, and startle reactivity, and that aberrant hippocampal function may contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases, in particular psychosis. The relation between different sensorimotor processes and hippocampal neurotransmission, the role of ventral and dorsal hippocampus, and the extrahippocampal mechanisms mediating the hippocampal modulation of different sensorimotor processes can partly be dissociated. Thus, the hippocampal modulation of these sensorimotor processes appears to reflect multiple operations, rather than one unitary operation.},

The CCK interneurons provide a surprisingly strong feedforward inhibitory drive to effectively control the coincident excitation of CA1 pyramidal neurons by convergent inputs. Thus, in-phase cortico-hippocampal activity provides a powerful heterosynaptic learning rule for long-term gating of information flow through the hippocampal excitatory macrocircuit by the silencing of the CCK inhibitory microcircuit.},

  abstract    = {An imbalance in the redox-state of the brain may be part of the underlying pathophysiology in schizophrenia. Inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, which can tip the redox balance into a pro-oxidant state, have been consistently found to be altered in schizophrenia patients. However, the relationship of altered redox-state to altered brain functions observed in the disease has been unclear. Recent data from a pharmacological model of schizophrenia suggest that redox and inflammatory imbalances may be directly linked to the pathophysiology of the disease by alterations in fast-spiking interneurons. Repetitive adult exposure to the NMDA-R antagonist ketamine increases the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 in brain which, through activation of the superoxide-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase (Nox2), leads to the loss of the GABAergic phenotype of PV-interneurons and to decreased inhibitory activity in prefrontal cortex. This effect is not observed after a single exposure to ketamine, suggesting that the first exposure to the NMDA-R antagonist primes the brain such that deleterious effects on PV-interneurons appear upon repetitive exposures. The effects of activation of the IL-6/Nox2 pathway on the PV-interneuronal system are reversible in the adult brain, but permanent in the developing cortex. The slow development of PV-interneurons, although essential for shaping of neuronal circuits during postnatal brain development, increases their vulnerability to deleterious insults that can permanently affect their maturational process. Thus, in individuals with genetic predisposition, the persistent activation of the IL-6/Nox2 pathway may be an environmental factor that tips the redox balance leading to schizophrenia symptoms in late adolescence and early adulthood.},

  abstract    = {Normal operations of the neocortex depend critically on several types of inhibitory interneurons, but the specific function of each type is unknown. One possibility is that interneurons are differentially engaged by patterns of activity that vary in frequency and timing. To explore this, we studied the strength and short-term dynamics of chemical synapses interconnecting local excitatory neurons (regular-spiking, or RS, cells) with two types of inhibitory interneurons: fast-spiking (FS) cells, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) cells of layer 4 in the rat barrel cortex. We also tested two other pathways onto the interneurons: thalamocortical connections and recurrent collaterals from corticothalamic projection neurons of layer 6. The excitatory and inhibitory synapses interconnecting RS cells and FS cells were highly reliable in response to single stimuli and displayed strong short-term depression. In contrast, excitatory and inhibitory synapses interconnecting the RS and LTS cells were less reliable when initially activated. Excitatory synapses from RS cells onto LTS cells showed dramatic short-term facilitation, whereas inhibitory synapses made by LTS cells onto RS cells facilitated modestly or slightly depressed. Thalamocortical inputs strongly excited both RS and FS cells but rarely and only weakly contacted LTS cells. Both types of interneurons were strongly excited by facilitating synapses from axon collaterals of corticothalamic neurons. We conclude that there are two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of synaptic inhibition in layer 4 of neocortex, each defined by its intrinsic spiking properties, the short-term plasticity of its chemical synapses, and (as shown previously) an exclusive set of electrical synapses. Because of their unique dynamic properties, each inhibitory network will be recruited by different temporal patterns of cortical activity.},

Activity in the theta, beta, and gamma bands is related to communication between PFC and different brain areas. While gamma/beta oscillations mediate bottom-up and top-down interactions between PFC and visual cortices, related to attention, theta rhythms are engaged by hippocampal/PFC interplay. These interactions are dynamic, depending on the nature and relevance of the information currently being processed. The profound modifications of the PFC neuronal network associated with changes in oscillatory coherence are controlled by neuromodulators such as dopamine, which thereby allow or prevent the formation of cell assemblies for information encoding and storage.},

  abstract    = {Studies of the hippocampus in postmortem brains from patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have provided evidence for a defect of GABAergic interneurons. Significant decreases in the expression of GAD67, a marker for GABA cell function, have been found repeatedly in several different brain regions that include the hippocampus. In this region, nicotinic receptors are thought to play an important role in modulating the activity of GABAergic interneurons by influences of excitatory cholinergic afferents on their activity. In bipolar disorder, this influence appears to be particularly prominent in the stratum oriens of sectors CA3/2 and CA1, two sites where these cells constitute the exclusive neuronal cell type. In sector CA3/2, this layer receives a robust excitatory projection from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and this is thought to play a central role in regulating GABA cells at this locus. Using laser microdissection, recent studies have focused selectively on these two layers and their associated GABA cells using microarray technology. The results have provided support for the idea that nicotinic cholinergic receptors play a particularly important role in regulating the activity of GABA neurons at these loci by regulating the progression of cell cycle and the repair of damaged DNA. In bipolar disorder, there is a prominent reduction in the expression of mRNAs for several different nicotinic subunit isoforms. These decreases could reflect a diminished influence of this receptor system on these GABA cells, particularly in sector CA3/2 where a preponderance of abnormalities have been observed in postmortem studies. In patients with bipolar disorder, excitatory nicotinic cholinergic fibers from the medial septum may converge with glutamatergic fibers from the BLA on GABAergic interneurons in the stratum oriens of CA3/2 and result in disturbances of their genomic and functional integrity, ones that may induce disruptions of the integration of microcircuitry within this region.},

Kinetic models of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)/ErbB receptor signalling pathway describing activation, desensitization, and tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR/ErbB followed by binding and activation of Src family kinases that is subsequently followed by phosphorylation of target proteins are available. We have adapted these to give a kinetic description of NMDAR modulation by Nrg that recapitulates the observed kinetics of autophosphorylation of the ErbB dimer as well as the modulation of the NMDAR by Src kinase, according to whether the kinases are activated or deactivated. This quantitative description of the Nrg/NMDAR pathway provides a model for experimental elucidation of what goes awry in animal models of schizophrenia.},

The episodic buffer as direct interface between episodic long-term memory (LTM) and working memory (WM) is fairly well studied but such direct interaction is less clear in semantic LTM. Here, we designed a verbal delayed-match-to-sample task specifically to differentiate between pure information maintenance and mental manipulation of memory traces with and without involvement of access to semantic LTM. Task-related amplitude differences of electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory brain activity showed a linear increase in frontal-midline theta and linear suppression of parietal beta amplitudes relative to memory operation complexity. Amplitude suppression at upper alpha frequency, which was previously found to indicate access to semantic LTM, was only sensitive to mental manipulation in general, irrespective of LTM involvement. This suggests that suppression of upper EEG alpha activity might rather reflect unspecific distributed cortical activation during complex mental processes than accessing semantic LTM.},

ECS network follows a scale-free topology, which confers robustness against random damage, easy navigability, and controllability. Network topological parameters, such as clustering coefficient (i.e., how the nodes form clusters) of 0.0009, network diameter (the longest shortest path among all pairs of nodes) of 12, averaged number of neighbors (the mean number of connections per node) of 3.073, and characteristic path length (the expected distance between two connected nodes) of 4.715, suggested that molecular messages are transferred through the ECS network quickly and specifically. Interestingly, ∼75\% of nodes are located on, or are active at the level of, the cell membrane. The hubs of ECS network are anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which have also the highest value of betweeness centrality, and their removal causes network collapse into multiple disconnected components. Importantly, AEA is a ubiquitous player while 2-AG plays more restricted actions. Instead, the product of their degradation, arachidonic acid, and their hydrolyzing enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase, FAAH, have a marginal impact on ECS network, indeed their removal did not significantly affect its topology.},

  abstract    = {Growing evidence indicates that the amygdala modulates hippocampal functions. To test the hypothesis that this modulation may involve long-lasting effects on interneuronal networks in the hippocampus, changes in the expression of neurochemical markers specific for different interneuronal subpopulations were assessed in adult rats 96 h following acute infusion of low doses of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin into the amygdala. The numerical density (Nd) of somata showing immunoreactivity (IR) for parvalbumin (PVB) was decreased in dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA4-2 region, while that of calretinin (CR)-IR was decreased in DG and CA2. The Nd of calbindin D28k (CB)-IR somata was decreased in CA3-2. The densities of axon terminals arising from PVB-IR and cholecystokinin (CCK)-IR basket neurons were also altered, with those of CCK-IR terminals increased across all sectors, while PVB-IR terminals were decreased only in the CA region. Increases in CCK-IR terminals were paralleled by increases of terminals with IR for the 65-kD isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65). Mixed-effects statistical models, adapted specifically for these analyses, indicated that perturbations of amygdalar inputs to the hippocampus significantly alter the drive that hippocampal PVB-, CR-, and CB-IR neurons within the dentate gyrus/CA4 region exercise on CCK-IR terminals within the same region as well as in CA3-1. These results suggest that amygdalar modulation of specific neuronal subpopulations may induce lasting and far-reaching changes in the hippocampus during normal functioning, as well as in diseases involving a disruption of amygdalar activity. In particular, changes in specific interneuronal markers within selective hippocampal sectors detected in the present results are strikingly similar to those reported in this region in schizophrenia. These similarities suggest that, in this disease, a disruption of GABAergic transmission within the amygdala may play a significant role in the induction of abnormalities in the hippocampus.},

Beyond estimating the cell numbers of GABAergic interneuron types, we calculate their convergence onto CA1 pyramidal cells and compare it with the known input synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells. The convergence calculation and comparison are also made for excitatory inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, we provide a summary of the excitatory and inhibitory convergence onto interneurons. The quantitative knowledge base assembled and synthesized here forms the basis for data-driven, large-scale computational modeling efforts. Additionally, this work highlights specific instances where the available data are incomplete, which should inspire targeted experimental projects toward a more complete quantification of the CA1 neurons and their connectivity.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis use can induce acute psychotic symptoms and increase the risk of schizophrenia. Impairments in inhibitory control and processing are known to occur both under the influence of cannabis and in schizophrenia. Whether cannabis-induced impairment in inhibitory processing is related to the acute induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence is unclear. We investigated the effects of acute oral administration of 10mg of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on inhibitory control and regional brain activation during inhibitory processing in humans and examined whether these effects are related to the induction of psychotic symptoms under its influence using a repeated-measures, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design. We studied thirty-six healthy, English-speaking, right-handed men with minimal previous exposure to cannabis and other illicit drugs twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a response inhibition (Go/No-Go) task. Relative to placebo, delta-9-THC caused transient psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication and sedation, inhibition errors and impaired inhibition efficiency. Severity of psychotic symptoms was directly correlated with inhibition error frequency and inversely with inhibition efficiency under the influence of delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC attenuated left inferior frontal activation which was inversely correlated with the frequency of inhibition errors and severity of psychotic symptoms and positively with inhibition efficiency under its influence. These results provide experimental evidence that impairments in cognitive processes involved in the inhibitory control of thoughts and actions and inferior frontal function under the influence of cannabis may have a role in the emergence of transient psychotic symptoms under its influence.},

The effect of Δ9-THC in the right caudate was negatively correlated with the severity of the psychotic symptoms it induced and its effect on response latency. The effects of CBD on task-related activation were in the opposite direction of those of Δ9-THC; relative to placebo, CBD augmented left caudate and hippocampal activation but attenuated right prefrontal activation.Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD differentially modulate prefrontal, striatal, and hippocampal function during attentional salience processing.

  abstract    = {There is now considerable evidence to support the hypothesis that psychotic symptoms are the result of abnormal salience attribution, and that the attribution of salience is largely mediated through the prefrontal cortex, the striatum, and the hippocampus. Although these areas show differential activation under the influence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), the two major derivatives of cannabis sativa, little is known about the effects of these cannabinoids on the functional connectivity between these regions. We investigated this in healthy occasional cannabis users by employing event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) following oral administration of delta-9-THC, CBD, or a placebo capsule. Employing a seed cluster-based functional connectivity analysis that involved using the average time series from each seed cluster for a whole-brain correlational analysis, we investigated the effect of drug condition on functional connectivity between the seed clusters and the rest of the brain during an oddball salience processing task. Relative to the placebo condition, delta-9-THC and CBD had opposite effects on the functional connectivity between the dorsal striatum, the prefrontal cortex, and the hippocampus. Delta-9-THC reduced fronto-striatal connectivity, which was related to its effect on task performance, whereas this connection was enhanced by CBD. Conversely, mediotemporal-prefrontal connectivity was enhanced by delta-9-THC and reduced by CBD. Our results suggest that the functional integration of brain regions involved in salience processing is differentially modulated by single doses of delta-9-THC and CBD and that this relates to the processing of salient stimuli.},

It is unclear where C. sativa acts in the human brain to modulate verbal learning and to induce psychotic symptoms.To investigate the effects of 2 main psychoactive constituents of C. sativa, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) and cannabidiol, on regional brain function during verbal paired associate learning.Subjects were studied on 3 separate occasions using a block design functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm while performing a verbal paired associate learning task. Each imaging session was preceded by the ingestion of Delta9-THC (10 mg), cannabidiol (600 mg), or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, repeated-measures, within-subject design.University research center.Fifteen healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed men of white race/ethnicity who had used C. sativa 15 times or less and had minimal exposure to other illicit drugs in their lifetime.Regional brain activation (blood oxygen level-dependent response), performance in a verbal learning task, and objective and subjective ratings of psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication, and sedation.Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol increased psychotic symptoms and levels of anxiety, intoxication, and sedation, whereas no significant effect was noted on these parameters following administration of cannabidiol. Performance in the verbal learning task was not significantly modulated by either drug. Administration of Delta9-THC augmented activation in the parahippocampal gyrus during blocks 2 and 3 such that the normal linear decrement in activation across repeated encoding blocks was no longer evident. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol also attenuated the normal time-dependent change in ventrostriatal activation during retrieval of word pairs, which was directly correlated with concurrently induced psychotic symptoms. In contrast, administration of cannabidiol had no such effect.The modulation of mediotemporal and ventrostriatal function by Delta9-THC may underlie the effects of C. sativa on verbal learning and psychotic symptoms, respectively.},

  abstract    = {Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD), the two main ingredients of the Cannabis sativa plant have distinct symptomatic and behavioral effects. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers to examine whether Delta-9-THC and CBD had opposite effects on regional brain function. We then assessed whether pretreatment with CBD can prevent the acute psychotic symptoms induced by Delta-9-THC. Fifteen healthy men with minimal earlier exposure to cannabis were scanned while performing a verbal memory task, a response inhibition task, a sensory processing task, and when viewing fearful faces. Subjects were scanned on three occasions, each preceded by oral administration of Delta-9-THC, CBD, or placebo. BOLD responses were measured using fMRI. In a second experiment, six healthy volunteers were administered Delta-9-THC intravenously on two occasions, after placebo or CBD pretreatment to examine whether CBD could block the psychotic symptoms induced by Delta-9-THC. Delta-9-THC and CBD had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the striatum during verbal recall, in the hippocampus during the response inhibition task, in the amygdala when subjects viewed fearful faces, in the superior temporal cortex when subjects listened to speech, and in the occipital cortex during visual processing. In the second experiment, pretreatment with CBD prevented the acute induction of psychotic symptoms by Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Delta-9-THC and CBD can have opposite effects on regional brain function, which may underlie their different symptomatic and behavioral effects, and CBD's ability to block the psychotogenic effects of Delta-9-THC.},

To examine the mechanism of the normal response and to delineate possible sites of its abnormality in psychosis, it would be desirable to reproduce the phenomenon in laboratory animals. In this study, we show that the pattern of diminished response to the second of paired auditory stimuli is found in activity recorded from the CA3 region of the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. The evoked potential recorded from this area is predominantly an N40 wave, at identical latency to the prominent negative wave recorded from the skull surface of unanesthetized rats. Similar responses were not found in other areas, including the auditory neocortex and the medial geniculate nucleus. Amphetamine, which diminished sensory gating in both animals and humans, diminished the gating of the evoked potential recorded in the hippocampus. The effect of amphetamine was reversed by haloperidol. The rat hippocampus may therefore contain neurons that can be used to study the neurobiology of sensory gating.},

  abstract    = {Prediction and prevention of psychosis have become major research topics. Clinical approaches warrant objective biological parameters to enhance validity in prediction of psychosis onset. In this regard, event-related potentials (ERPs) have been identified as promising tools for improving psychosis prediction.Herein, the focus is on sensory gating, mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300, thereby discussing which parameters allow for a timely and valid detection of future converters to psychosis. In a first step, we systematically reviewed the studies that resulted from a search of the MEDLINE database. In a second step, we performed a meta-analysis of those investigations reporting transitions that statistically compared ERPs in converting versus nonconverting subjects.Sensory gating, MMN, and P300 have been demonstrated to be impaired in subjects clinically at risk of developing a psychotic disorder. In the meta-analysis, duration MMN achieved the highest effect size measures.In summary, MMN studies have produced the most convincing results until now, including independent replication of the predictive validity. However, a synopsis of the literature revealed a relative paucity of ERP studies addressing the psychosis risk state. Considering the high clinical relevance of valid psychosis prediction, future research should question for the most informative paradigms and should allow for meta-analytic evaluation with regard to specificity and sensitivity of the most appropriate parameters.},

  abstract    = {SK channels play a fundamental role in all excitable cells. SK channels are potassium selective and are activated by an increase in the level of intracellular calcium, such as occurs during an action potential. Their activation causes membrane hyperpolarization, which inhibits cell firing and limits the firing frequency of repetitive action potentials. The intracellular calcium increase evoked by action potential firing decays slowly, allowing SK channel activation to generate a long-lasting hyperpolarization termed the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP). This spike-frequency adaptation protects the cell from the deleterious effects of continuous tetanic activity and is essential for normal neurotransmission. Slow AHPs can be classified into two groups, based on sensitivity to the bee venom toxin apamin. In general, apamin-sensitive sAHPs activate rapidly following a single action potential and decay with a time constant of approximately 150 ms. In contrast, apamin-insensitive sAHPs rise slowly and decay with a time constant of approximately 1.5 s. The basis for this kinetic difference is not yet understood. Apamin-sensitive and apamin-insensitive SK channels have recently been cloned. This chapter will compare with different classes of sAHPs, discuss the cloned SK channels and how they are gated by calcium ions, describe the molecular basis for their different pharmacologies, and review the possible role of SK channels in several pathological conditions.},

However, it has been suggested that schizophrenia, but not BP, is characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities that can lead to cognitive deficits at the earliest stages of the illness. The aim of this meta-analytic review was to compare neurocognitive deficits in first-episode BP (FEBP) with healthy controls and first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients. The current meta-analysis included a total of 22 adult studies and involved comparisons of 533 FEBP patients with 1417 healthy controls and 605 FEBP and 822 FES patients. FEBP patients were significantly impaired in all cognitive domains (d = 0.26-0.80) and individual tasks (d = 0.22-0.66) investigated. FES patients significantly underperformed FEBP patients in most cognitive domains (d = 0.05-0.63) and on individual tasks (d = 0.13-0.77). Neuropsychological impairment, which is comparable to chronic BP, was evident in FEBP. Similar to chronic patients, cognitive functions in FEBP lie intermediate between FES and healthy controls. Neurodevelopmental factors are likely to play a significant role not only in schizophrenia but also in BP.},

  abstract    = {It has recently been suggested that cognitive impairment should be included in the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia. One of the main arguments in support of this suggestion has been the hope that cognitive impairment can help distinguish schizophrenia from bipolar disorder (BD). However, recent evidence shows that cognitive deficits occur in BD and persist beyond euthymia. Further, mood disorders with psychotic features might be expected to manifest greater cognitive impairment, which further complicates the potential to differentiate these disorders. The goal of the current meta-analysis was to examine the magnitude and characteristics of cognitive impairments in affective psychoses (AP). A systematic search of the existing literature sourced 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria. These studies compared cognitive performances of 763 patients with AP (550 BD and 213 major depressive disorder) and 1823 healthy controls. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to examine the effects of moderator variables. Meta-analyses of these studies showed that patients with AP were impaired in all 15 cognitive tasks with large effect sizes for most measures. There were no significant differences between the magnitude of impairments between the BD and major depressive disorder groups. The largest effect size was found for symbol coding, stroop task, verbal learning, and category fluency, reflecting impairments in elementary and complex aspects of attentional processing, as well as learning and memory. In general, the pattern of cognitive impairments in AP was similar to reported findings in euthymic patients with BD, but relatively more pronounced.},

In contrast, CBD deactivated the left temporal cortex and insula.

  abstract    = {Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). A neurocognitive profile characterized by widespread cognitive deficits across multiple domains in the context of substantial intellectual impairment, which appears to antedate illness onset, is a replicated finding in SZ. There is no specific neuropsychological signature that can facilitate the diagnostic differentiation of SZ and BD, notwithstanding, neuropsychological deficits appear more severe in SZ. The literature in this field has provided contradictory results due to methodological differences across studies. Meta-analytic techniques may offer an opportunity to synthesize findings and to control for potential sources of heterogeneity. Here, we performed a systematic review of meta-analyses of neuropsychological findings in SZ and BD. While there is no conclusive evidence for progressive cognitive deterioration in either SZ or BD, some findings point to more severe cognitive deficits in patients with early illness onset across both disorders. A compromised pattern of cognitive functioning in individuals at familiar and/or clinical risk to psychosis as well as in first-degree relatives of BD patients suggests that early neurodevelopmental factors may play a role in the emergence of cognitive deficits in both disorders. Premorbid intellectual impairment in SZ and at least in a subgroup of patients with BD may be related to a shared genetically determined influence on neurodevelopment.},

  abstract    = {Deficits in memory function are an incapacitating aspect of various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Animal studies have recently provided strong evidence for involvement of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system in memory function. Neuropsychological studies in humans have shown less convincing evidence but suggest that administration of cannabinoid substances affects encoding rather than recall of information. In this study, we examined the effects of perturbation of the eCB system on memory function during both encoding and recall. We performed a pharmacological MRI study with a placebo-controlled, crossover design, investigating the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) inhalation on associative memory-related brain function in 13 healthy volunteers. Performance and brain activation during associative memory were assessed using a pictorial memory task, consisting of separate encoding and recall conditions. Administration of THC caused reductions in activity during encoding in the right insula, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the left middle occipital gyrus and a network-wide increase in activity during recall, which was most prominent in bilateral cuneus and precuneus. THC administration did not affect task performance, but while during placebo recall activity significantly explained variance in performance, this effect disappeared after THC. These findings suggest eCB involvement in encoding of pictorial information. Increased precuneus activity could reflect impaired recall function, but the absence of THC effects on task performance suggests a compensatory mechanism. These results further emphasize the eCB system as a potential novel target for treatment of memory disorders and a promising target for development of new therapies to reduce memory deficits in humans.},

However, before new research can focus on potential treatments that work by manipulating the endocannabinoid system, it needs to be elucidated how this system is involved in symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we review human studies that investigated acute effects of cannabis or ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain functions that are implicated in schizophrenia. Results suggest that the impact of THC administration depends on the difficulty of the task performed. Impaired performance of cognitive paradigms is reported on more challenging tasks, which is associated with both activity deficits in temporal and prefrontal areas and a failure to deactivate regions of the default mode network. Comparable reductions in prefrontal activity and impairments in deactivation of the default mode network are seen in patients during performance of cognitive paradigms. Normal performance levels after THC administration demonstrated for less demanding tasks are shown to be related to either increased neural effort in task-specific regions ('neurophysiological inefficiency'), or recruitment of alternative brain areas, which suggests a change in strategy to meet cognitive demands. Particularly a pattern of performance and brain activity corresponding with an inefficient working memory system is consistently demonstrated in patients. These similarities in brain function between intoxicated healthy volunteers and schizophrenia patients provide an argument for a role of the endocannabinoid system in symptoms of schizophrenia, and further emphasize this system as a potential novel target for treatment of these symptoms.},

Executive function appears to be associated with both modulation of active networks and inhibition of activity in the default mode network. In the present study, we examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in executive function, focusing on both the associated brain network and the default mode network. A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, investigating effects of the endocannabinoid agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on executive function in 20 healthy volunteers, using a continuous performance task with identical pairs. Task performance was impaired after THC administration, reflected in both an increase in false alarms and a reduction in detected targets. This was associated with reduced deactivation in a set of brain regions linked to the default mode network, including posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. Less deactivation was significantly correlated with lower performance after THC. Regions that were activated by the continuous performance task, notably bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, did not show effects of THC. These findings suggest an important role for the endocannabinoid system in both default mode modulation and executive function.

In the placebo condition, brain activity increased linearly with rising WM load. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol administration enhanced activity for low WM loads and reduced the linear relationship between WM load and activity in the WM system as a whole and in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, and cerebellum in particular.Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol enhanced WM activity network-wide for low loads, while reducing the load-dependent response for increasing WM loads. These results indicate that a challenged eCB system can induce both abnormal WM activity and WM performance deficits and provide an argument for the possibility of eCB involvement in WM deficits in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Elevated dopamine function is thought to play a key role in both the rewarding effects of addictive drugs and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Accumulating epidemiological evidence indicates that cannabis use is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. However, human neurochemical imaging studies that examined the impact of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis, on striatal dopamine release have provided inconsistent results.The objective of this study is to assess the effect of a THC challenge on human striatal dopamine release in a large sample of healthy participants.We combined human neurochemical imaging data from two previous studies that used [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) (n = 7 and n = 13, respectively) to examine the effect of THC on striatal dopamine neurotransmission in humans. PET images were re-analysed to overcome differences in PET data analysis.THC administration induced a significant reduction in [(11)C]raclopride binding in the limbic striatum (-3.65 \%, from 2.39 ± 0.26 to 2.30 ± 0.23, p = 0.023). This is consistent with increased dopamine levels in this region. No significant differences between THC and placebo were found in other striatal subdivisions.In the largest data set of healthy participants so far, we provide evidence for a modest increase in human striatal dopamine transmission after administration of THC compared to other drugs of abuse. This finding suggests limited involvement of the endocannabinoid system in regulating human striatal dopamine release and thereby challenges the hypothesis that an increase in striatal dopamine levels after cannabis use is the primary biological mechanism underlying the associated higher risk of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {The influence of cannabis on mental health receives growing scientific and political attention. An increasing demand for treatment of cannabis dependence has refueled the discussion about the addictive potential of cannabis. A key feature of all addictive drugs is the ability to increase synaptic dopamine levels in the striatum, a mechanism involved in their rewarding and motivating effects. However, it is currently unknown if cannabis can stimulate striatal dopamine neurotransmission in humans. Here we show that Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis, induces dopamine release in the human striatum. Using the dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor tracer [(11)C]raclopride and positron emission tomography in seven healthy subjects, we demonstrate that THC inhalation reduces [(11)C]raclopride binding in the ventral striatum and the precommissural dorsal putamen but not in other striatal subregions. This is consistent with an increase in dopamine levels in these regions. These results suggest that THC shares a potentially addictive property with other drugs of abuse. Further, it implies that the endogenous cannabinoid system is involved in regulating striatal dopamine release. This allows new directions in research on the effects of THC in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Various psychiatric disorders such as major depression are associated with abnormalities in emotional processing. Evidence indicating involvement of the endocannabinoid system in emotional processing, and thus potentially in related abnormalities, is increasing. In the present study, we examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in processing of stimuli with a positive and negative emotional content in healthy volunteers. A pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, investigating effects of the endocannabinoid agonist ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain function related to emotional processing in 11 healthy subjects. Performance and brain activity during matching of stimuli with a negative ('fearful faces') or a positive content ('happy faces') were assessed after placebo and THC administration. After THC administration, performance accuracy was decreased for stimuli with a negative but not for stimuli with a positive emotional content. Our task activated a network of brain regions including amygdala, orbital frontal gyrus, hippocampus, parietal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and regions in the occipital cortex. THC interacted with emotional content, as activity in this network was reduced for negative content, while activity for positive content was increased. These results indicate that THC administration reduces the negative bias in emotional processing. This adds human evidence to support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system is involved in modulation of emotional processing. Our findings also suggest a possible role for the endocannabinoid system in abnormal emotional processing, and may thus be relevant for psychiatric disorders such as major depression.},

Studies were classified based on a 4-step approach based on guidelines for evaluating the clinical usefulness of a diagnostic test.Our review and meta-analysis revealed that most of the abnormalities are replicated in the expected directions with the most consistent results related to the increased preponderance of slow rhythms in schizophrenia patients. This effect remained consistent in un-medicated patients.

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1\% of the population. Reduced expression of the 67-kDa protein isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) is a hallmark of the disease and is encoded by the GAD1 gene. In schizophrenia, GAD67 downregulation occurs in multiple interneuronal subpopulations, including the cannabinoid receptor type 1 positive (CNR1+) cells, but the functional consequences of these disturbances are not well understood. To investigate the role of the CNR1-positive GABA-ergic interneurons in behavioral and molecular processes, we employed a novel, miRNA-mediated transgenic mouse approach. We silenced the Gad1 transcript using a miRNA engineered to specifically target Gad1 mRNA under the control of Cnr1 bacterial artificial chromosome. Behavioral characterization of our transgenic mice showed elevated and persistent conditioned fear associated with an auditory cue and a significantly altered response to an amphetamine challenge. These deficits could not be attributed to sensory deficits or changes in baseline learning and memory. Furthermore, HPLC analyses revealed that Cnr1/Gad1 mice have enhanced serotonin levels, but not dopamine levels in response to amphetamine. Our findings demonstrate that dysfunction of a small subset of interneurons can have a profound effect on behavior and that the GABA-ergic, monoamine, and cannabinoid systems are functionally interconnected. The results also suggest that understanding the function of various interneuronal subclasses might be essential to develop knowledge-based treatment strategies for various mental disorders including schizophrenia and substance abuse.},

  abstract    = {In monkeys proficient in the performance of a computer-assisted delayed response task, administration of sub-sedative doses of ketamine significantly impaired task performance after the 2mg/kg dose, producing a decrease in accuracies across all four delay intervals. Ketamine elicited occasional and inconsistent increases in task latencies. But in general processing speed was not dramatically affected by the test dose. Pretreatment with the alpha7 nicotinic receptor agonist GTS-21 (DMXB-A) [3-[(3E)-3-[(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl) methylidene]-5,6-dihydro-4H-pyridin-2-yl]pyridine] produced a dose-dependent attenuation of ketamine-induced decreases in task accuracies. In fact, the best dose of GTS-21 completely reversed the effects of ketamine. The nicotine metabolite cotinine is a cognitive-enhancer, and active in models predictive of antipsychotic activity. Pretreatment with cotinine did not reverse the task deficits produced by ketamine, and selection of a best dose was necessary to show the activity of cotinine. However, the best dose of cotinine, like GTS-21, completely reversed the ketamine-induced task deficits. Task accuracies were increased relative to their non-ketamine baselines during sessions run 24h later. The cotinine-ketamine order of administration was reversed to provide a more clinically relevant model, and cotinine post-treatment regimen produced a clear reversal of the ketamine-induced task deficits. The protracted task improvement also was still evident. The DMTS task impairment induced by ketamine was capable of being completely reversed by two compounds that are known to improve working memory and cognition. The model could provide a means of late stage preclinical evaluation of new compounds that address the cognitive impairment associated with major psychotic disease.},

  abstract    = {Recent human clinical studies with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine have revealed profound and long-lasting antidepressant effects with rapid onset in several clinical trials, but antidepressant effects were preceded by dissociative side effects. Here we show that GLYX-13, a novel NMDAR glycine-site functional partial agonist, produces an antidepressant-like effect in the Porsolt, novelty induced hypophagia, and learned helplessness tests in rats without exhibiting substance abuse-related, gating, and sedative side effects of ketamine in the drug discrimination, conditioned place preference, pre-pulse inhibition and open-field tests. Like ketamine, the GLYX-13-induced antidepressant-like effects required AMPA/kainate receptor activation, as evidenced by the ability of NBQX to abolish the antidepressant-like effect. Both GLYX-13 and ketamine persistently (24 h) enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and the magnitude of NMDAR-NR2B conductance at rat Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in vitro. Cell surface biotinylation studies showed that both GLYX-13 and ketamine led to increases in both NR2B and GluR1 protein levels, as measured by Western analysis, whereas no changes were seen in mRNA expression (microarray and qRT-PCR). GLYX-13, unlike ketamine, produced its antidepressant-like effect when injected directly into the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that GLYX-13 produces an antidepressant-like effect without the side effects seen with ketamine at least in part by directly modulating NR2B-containing NMDARs in the MPFC. Furthermore, the enhancement of 'metaplasticity' by both GLYX-13 and ketamine may help explain the long-lasting antidepressant effects of these NMDAR modulators. GLYX-13 is currently in a Phase II clinical development program for treatment-resistant depression.},

The minicolumn is a sophisticated local network that contains within it the elements for redundancy and plasticity. Although it is sometimes compared to subcortical nuclei, the design of the minicolumn is a distinctive form of module that has evolved specifically in the neocortex. It unites the horizontal and vertical components of cortex within the same cortical space. Minicolumns are often considered highly repetitive, even clone-like, units. However, they display considerable heterogeneity between areas and species, perhaps even within a given macrocolumn. Despite a growing recognition of the anatomical basis of the cortical minicolumn, as well as its physiological properties, the potential of the minicolumn has not been exploited in fields such as comparative neuroanatomy, abnormalities of the brain and mind, and evolution.},

  abstract    = {We present a quantified imaging method that describes the cell column in mammalian cortex. The minicolumn is an ideal template with which to examine cortical organization because it is a basic unit of function, complete in itself, which interacts with adjacent and distance columns to form more complex levels of organization. The subtle details of columnar anatomy should reflect physiological changes that have occurred in evolution as well as those that might be caused by pathologies in the brain. In this semiautomatic method, images of Nissl-stained tissue are digitized or scanned into a computer imaging system. The software detects the presence of cell columns and describes details of their morphology and of the surrounding space. Columns are detected automatically on the basis of cell-poor and cell-rich areas using a Gaussian distribution. A line is fit to the cell centers by least squares analysis. The line becomes the center of the column from which the precise location of every cell can be measured. On this basis several algorithms describe the distribution of cells from the center line and in relation to the available surrounding space. Other algorithms use cluster analyses to determine the spatial orientation of every column.},

  abstract    = {Voltage-dependent potassium (K+) channels (Kv) regulate cell excitability by controlling the movement of K+ ions across the membrane in response to changes in the cell voltage. The Kv family, which includes A-type channels, constitute the largest group of K+ channel genes within the superfamily of Na+, Ca2+ and K+ voltage-gated channels. The name "A-type" stems from the typical profile of these currents that results form the opposing effects of fast activation and inactivation. In neuronal cells, A-type currents (I(A)), determine the interval between two consecutive action potentials during repetitive firing. In cardiac muscle, A-type currents (I(to)), control the initial repolarization of the myocardium. Structurally, A-type channels are tetramers of alpha-subunits each containing six putative transmembrane domains including a voltage-sensor. A-type channels can be modulated by means of protein-protein interactions with so-called beta-subunits that control inactivation voltage sensitivity and other properties, and by post-transcriptional modifications such as phosphorylation or oxidation. Recently a new mode of A-type regulation has been discovered in the form of a class of hybrid beta-subunits that posses their own enzymatic activity. Here, we review the biophysical and physiological properties of these multiple modes of A-type channel regulation.},

Here we investigated the dynamics of oscillatory coupling in the hippocampus of awake rats upon NMDA receptor blockade by ketamine, a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. Ketamine (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg i.p.) increased gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFO) in all depths of the CA1-dentate axis, while theta power changes depended on anatomical location and were independent of a transient increase of delta oscillations. Phase coherence of gamma and HFO increased across hippocampal layers. Phase-amplitude coupling between theta and fast oscillations was markedly altered in a dose-dependent manner: ketamine increased hippocampal theta-HFO coupling at all doses, while theta-gamma coupling increased at the lowest dose and was disrupted at the highest dose. Our results demonstrate that ketamine alters network interactions that underlie cognitively relevant theta-gamma coupling.},

  abstract    = {Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to be caused by altered synaptic transmission in circuits of the prefrontal cortex. 2 main hypotheses have been put forward: reduced inhibition and hypofunctional NMDA receptors. Recently, Lee et al. (2008) found that spatial working memory deficits in schizophrenic patients include a disproportionately high incidence of high-confidence error responses. Here, we have studied what synaptic dysfunction can generate this specific behavioral deficit using a computational network model of spatial working memory. We developed quantitative behavioral readout from our network simulations, which reflected the qualitative properties of underlying neural dynamics. We then analyzed the behavioral effect of the GABAergic and glutamatergic hypotheses on our network simulations. We found that reduction in inhibitory transmission in the network caused a reduction in performance through an increase of high-confidence errors, as in the experimental data. In contrast, a concerted reduction in NMDA-receptor-dependent transmission reduced performance via increased low-confidence errors. Only when NMDA receptors were specifically depleted in interneurons did the behavioral read-out of our network mimic the behavioral results for schizophrenic patients. Thus, dynamics in our model network support a role of both global inhibition reduction and hypofunctional NMDA receptors in interneurons in generating the behavioral deficits of simple spatial working memory tasks in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {It is unclear whether, like in schizophrenia, psychosis-related disruption in connectivity between certain regions, as an index of intrinsic functional disintegration, occurs in schizophrenia-like psychosis of epilepsy (SLPE). In this study, we sought to determine abnormal patterns of resting-state EEG oscillations and functional connectivity in patients with SLPE, compared with nonpsychotic epilepsy patients, and to assess correlations with psychopathological deficits.Resting EEG was recorded in 21 patients with focal epilepsy and SLPE and in 21 clinically-matched non-psychotic epilepsy controls. Source current density and functional connectivity were determined using eLORETA software. For connectivity analysis, a novel nonlinear connectivity measure called "lagged phase synchronization" was used. We found increased theta oscillations in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN), namely the medial and lateral parietal cortex bilaterally in the psychotic patients relative to their nonpsychotic counterparts. In addition, patients with psychosis had increased beta temporo-prefrontal connectivity in the hemisphere with predominant seizure focus. This functional connectivity in temporo-prefrontal circuits correlated with positive symptoms. Additionally, there was increased interhemispheric phase synchronization between the auditory cortex of the affected temporal lobe and the Broca's area correlating with auditory hallucination scores.In addition to dysfunction of parietal regions that are part of the DMN, resting-state disrupted connectivity of the medial temporal cortex with prefrontal areas that are either involved in the DMN or implicated in psychopathological dysfunction may be critical to schizophrenia-like psychosis, especially in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. This suggests that DMN deficits might be a core neurobiological feature of the disorder, and that abnormalities in theta oscillations and beta phase synchronization represent the underlying neural activity.},

Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.},

  abstract    = {Recurrent excitation is believed to underlie persistent neural activity observed in the prefrontal cortex and elsewhere during working memory. However, other positive and negative feedback mechanisms, operating on disparate timescales, may also play significant roles in determining the behavior of a working memory circuit. In this study, we examined dynamical interactions of multiple feedback mechanisms in a biophysically based neural model of spatial working memory. In such continuous attractor networks, a self-sustained activity pattern tends to drift randomly, resulting in a decreased accuracy of memory over time. Moreover, attractor states become unstable when spike-frequency adaptation reduces the excitability of persistently firing pyramidal neurons. Here, we show that a slow activity-dependent local disinhibition, namely cannabinoid-dependent depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), can counteract these destabilizing effects, rendering working memory function more robust. In addition, the slow DSI effect gives rise to trial-to-trial correlations of memory-guided behavioral responses. On the other hand, computer simulations revealed that a global cannabinoid agonist (mimicking the effect of drug intake) yields the opposite effect. Thus, this work suggests a circuit scenario according to which endogenous DSI is beneficial for, whereas an exogenous drug such as marijuana is detrimental to, working memory and possibly other prefrontal functions.},

  abstract    = {The physiological and molecular features of nonpyramidal cells were investigated in acute slices of sensory-motor cortex using whole-cell recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR to detect simultaneously the mRNAs of three calcium binding proteins (calbindin D28k, parvalbumin, and calretinin) and four neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, somatostatin, and cholecystokinin). In the 97 neurons analyzed, all expressed mRNAs of at least one calcium binding protein, and the majority (n = 73) contained mRNAs of at least one neuropeptide. Three groups of nonpyramidal cells were defined according to their firing pattern. (1) Fast spiking cells (n = 34) displayed tonic discharges of fast action potentials with no accommodation. They expressed parvalbumin (n = 30) and/or calbindin (n = 19) mRNAs, and half of them also contained transcripts of at least one of the four neuropeptides. (2) Regular spiking nonpyramidal cells (n = 48) displayed a firing behavior characterized by a marked accommodation and presented a large diversity of expression patterns of the seven biochemical markers. (3) Finally, a small population of vertically oriented bipolar cells, termed irregular spiking cells (n = 15), fired bursts of action potentials at an irregular frequency. They consistently co-expressed calretinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Additional investigations of these cells showed that they also co-expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyl transferase. Our results indicate that neocortical nonpyramidal neurons display a large diversity in their firing properties and biochemical patterns of co-expression and that both characteristics could be correlated to define discrete subpopulations.},

We developed a computational model based primarily on a unified set of brain activity mapping studies of mouse M1. The simulation consisted of 775 spiking neurons of 10 cell types with detailed population-to-population connectivity. Static analysis of connectivity with graph-theoretic tools revealed that the corticostriatal population showed strong centrality, suggesting that would provide a network hub. Subsequent dynamical analysis confirmed this observation, in addition to revealing network dynamics that cannot be readily predicted through analysis of the wiring diagram alone. Activation thresholds depended on the stimulated layer. Low stimulation produced transient activation, while stronger activation produced sustained oscillations where the threshold for sustained responses varied by layer: 13\% in layer 2/3, 54\% in layer 5A, 25\% in layer 5B, and 17\% in layer 6. The frequency and phase of the resulting oscillation also depended on stimulation layer. By demonstrating the effectiveness of combined static and dynamic analysis, our results show how static brain maps can be related to the results of brain activity mapping.},

  abstract  = {{NMDA} spikes are prominent in the basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons and greatly expand their ability to integrate synaptic inputs. Calcium {(Ca)} signals during these spikes are important for synaptic plasticity and fundamentally depend on activation of {NMDA} receptors. However, the factors that shape the activation of these receptors and the initiation of {NMDA} spikes remain unclear. Here we examine the properties of {NMDA} spikes in the basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Using two-photon imaging, we demonstrate that {NMDA} spikes evoke large Ca signals in both postsynaptic spines and nearby dendrites. We find that the dendrite Ca signals depend on {NMDA} and {AMPA} receptors but not sodium {(Na)} or Ca channels. Using voltage-clamp recordings, we show that activation of dendrite {NMDA} receptors is enhanced by concerted synaptic activity. Blocking glutamate reuptake further increases activation of these receptors and promotes the initiation of {NMDA} spikes. We conclude that glutamate spillover and recruitment of extrasynaptic receptors contribute to the initiation of {NMDA} spikes. These results have important implications for how synaptic activity generates both electrical and biochemical signals in dendrites and spines.},

  abstract    = {The presence of asymmetry in the human cerebral hemispheres is detectable at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales. The horizontal expansion of cortical surface during development (within individual brains), and across evolutionary time (between species), is largely due to the proliferation and spacing of the microscopic vertical columns of cells that form the cortex. In the asymmetric planum temporale (PT), minicolumn width asymmetry is associated with surface area asymmetry. Although the human minicolumn asymmetry is not large, it is estimated to account for a surface area asymmetry of approximately 9\% of the region's size. Critically, this asymmetry of minicolumns is absent in the equivalent areas of the brains of other apes. The left-hemisphere dominance for processing speech is thought to depend, partly, on a bias for higher resolution processing across widely spaced minicolumns with less overlapping dendritic fields, whereas dense minicolumn spacing in the right hemisphere is associated with more overlapping, lower resolution, holistic processing. This concept refines the simple notion that a larger brain area is associated with dominance for a function and offers an alternative explanation associated with "processing type." This account is mechanistic in the sense that it offers a mechanism whereby asymmetrical components of structure are related to specific functional biases yielding testable predictions, rather than the generalization that "bigger is better" for any given function. Face processing provides a test case - it is the opposite of language, being dominant in the right hemisphere. Consistent with the bias for holistic, configural processing of faces, the minicolumns in the right-hemisphere fusiform gyrus are thinner than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with featural processing. Again, this asymmetry is not found in chimpanzees. The difference between hemispheres may also be seen in terms of processing speed, facilitated by asymmetric myelination of white matter tracts (Anderson et al., 1999 found that axons of the left posterior superior temporal lobe were more thickly myelinated). By cross-referencing the differences between the active fields of the two hemispheres, via tracts such as the corpus callosum, the relationship of local features to global features may be encoded. The emergent hierarchy of features within features is a recursive structure that may functionally contribute to generativity - the ability to perceive and express layers of structure and their relations to each other. The inference is that recursive generativity, an essential component of language, reflects an interaction between processing biases that may be traceable in the microstructure of the cerebral cortex. Minicolumn organization in the PT and the prefrontal cortex has been found to correlate with cognitive scores in humans. Altered minicolumn organization is also observed in neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Indeed, altered interhemispheric connections correlated with minicolumn asymmetry in schizophrenia may relate to language-processing anomalies that occur in the disorder. Schizophrenia is associated with over-interpretation of word meaning at the semantic level and over-interpretation of relevance at the level of pragmatic competence, whereas autism is associated with overly literal interpretation of word meaning and under-interpretation of social relevance at the pragmatic level. Both appear to emerge from a disruption of the ability to interpret layers of meaning and their relations to each other. This may be a consequence of disequilibrium in the processing of local and global features related to disorganization of minicolumnar units of processing.},

Using cell-attached, voltage-clamp recordings, we found a large variability in the waveforms of macroscopic K(+) currents in the dendrites. With single-channel analysis, however, we were able to identify four types of voltage-dependent K(+) channels and we categorized them as belonging to delayed-rectifier, M-, D-, or A-type K(+) channels previously described from whole-cell recordings. Delayed-rectifier-type K(+) channels had a single-channel conductance of 19 +/- 0.5 pS, and made up the majority of the sustained K(+) current uniformly distributed along the apical dendrites. The M-type K(+) channels had a single-channel conductance of 11 +/- 0.8 pS, did not inactivate with prolonged membrane depolarization, deactivated with slow kinetics (time constant 100 +/- 6 ms at -40 mV), and were inhibited by bath-applied muscarinic agonist carbachol (10 microm). The D-type K(+) channels had a single-channel conductance of around 18 pS, and inactivated with a time constant of 98 +/- 4 ms at +54 mV. The A-type K(+) channels had a single-channel conductance of 6 +/- 0.6 pS, inactivated with a time constant of 23 +/- 2 ms at +54 mV, and contributed to the majority of the transient K(+) current previously described. These results suggest both functional and molecular complexity for K(+) channels in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurones.},

  abstract    = {Learning is believed to depend on lasting changes in synaptic efficacy such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. As a result, a profusion of studies has tried to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these forms of plasticity. Traditionally, experience-dependent changes at excitatory synapses were assumed to underlie learning and memory formation. However, with the relatively more recent investigation of inhibitory transmission, it had become evident that inhibitory synapses are not only plastic, but also provide an additional way to modulate excitatory transmission and the induction of plasticity at excitatory synapses. Thanks to recent technological advances, progress has been made in understanding synaptic transmission and plasticity from particular interneuron subtypes. In this review article, we will describe various forms of synaptic plasticity that have been ascribed to two fairly well characterized populations of interneurons in the hippocampus, those expressing cholecystokinin (CCK) and parvalbumin (PV). We will discuss the resulting changes in the strength and plasticity of excitatory transmission that occur in the local circuit as a result of the modulation of inhibitory transmission. We will focus on the hippocampus because this region has a relatively well-understood circuitry, numerous forms of activity-dependent plasticity and a multitude of identified interneuron subclasses.},

These findings suggested the existence of signaling interplay between mesolimbic dopamine and CB₁R. In this study, we further investigate interactions between CB₁R and dopamine D2 receptor (D₂R) signaling. Activation of either CB₁R or D₂R increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, while co-stimulation of CB₁R and D2 R evoked an additive effect on the phospho-ERK1/2 signal. This effect was mediated through a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi/o pathway in primary striatal cells. Furthermore, the mRNA level of CB₁R was increased via dopamine D2 receptor short form (D(2S)R) by treatment with D₂R agonist quinpirole in D(2S)R/C6 glioma cells. This effect could be suppressed by co-treatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. To test if D(2S)R could transcriptionally regulate CB₁R, the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene was sequenced from rat brain. Results showed that the CNR1 gene includes two exons, which contain 375 bp of 5'-UTR and are separated by a 17-kb intron. A luciferase reporter assay showed that the maximal D(2S)R-responsive promoter activity is located in the -1 to -222 region of CNR1 promoter. Overall, we demonstrate previously unidentified crosstalk between D₂R and CB₁R via ERK1/2 signaling that enhances the expression of CB₁R by modulating its promoter activity.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoid CB(1) and the metabotropic GABA(B) receptors have been shown to display similar pharmacological effects and co-localization in certain brain regions. Previous studies have reported a functional link between the two systems. As a first step to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism, here we show cross-inhibition of G-protein signaling between GABA(B) and CB(1) receptors in rat hippocampal membranes. The CB(1) agonist R-Win55,212-2 displayed high potency and efficacy in stimulating guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate, [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. Its effect was completely blocked by the specific CB(1) antagonist AM251 suggesting that the signaling was via CB(1) receptors. The GABA(B) agonists baclofen and SKF97541 also elevated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding by about 60\%, with potency values in the micromolar range. Phaclofen behaved as a low potency antagonist with an ED(50) approximately 1mM. However, phaclofen at low doses (1 and 10nM) slightly but significantly attenuated maximal stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding by the CB(1) agonist R-Win55,212-2. The observation that higher concentrations of phaclofen had no such effect rule out the possibility of its direct action on CB(1) receptors. The pharmacologically inactive stereoisomer S-Win55,212-3 had no effect either alone or in combination with phaclofen establishing that the interaction is stereospecific in hippocampus. The specific CB(1) antagonist AM251 at a low dose (1 nM) also inhibited the efficacy of G-protein signaling of the GABA(B) receptor agonist SKF97541. Cross-talk of the two receptor systems was not detected in either spinal cord or cerebral cortex membranes. It is speculated that the interaction might occur via an allosteric interaction between a subset of GABA(B) and CB(1) receptors in rat hippocampal membranes. Although the exact molecular mechanism of the reciprocal inhibition between CB(1) and GABA(B) receptors will have to be explored by future studies it is intriguing that the cross-talk might be involved in balance tuning the endocannabinoid and GABAergic signaling in hippocampus.},

This study investigated the effects of stimulant medications on the EEG of children with the Inattentive type of ADHD. An initial EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and Fourier transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates for the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. Theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios were also calculated. Subjects were placed on a 6-month trial of a stimulant and a second EEG was recorded at the end of the trial. Subjects were included in this study only if they showed a good clinical response during the trial. The unmedicated ADHD group had significantly greater absolute and relative theta, less relative alpha, and higher theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios than the control group. The stimulant medications resulted in a normalisation of the EEG, with changes in the theta, alpha and beta bands being most evident. These results suggest that stimulants act to increase cortical arousal in children with ADHD, normalising their EEG.},

  abstract  = {{OBJECTIVE} {NMDA} receptor dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The {NMDA} receptor is a multimeric ligand-gated ion channel, and the obligate {NR(1)} subunit is expressed as one of eight isoforms due to the alternative splicing of exons 5, 21, and 22. Alternative splicing of {NR(1)} subunits modulates receptor function by influencing the association of {NR(1)} with other {NMDA} receptor subunits and myriad intracellular molecules, such as the postsynaptic density family of proteins that target {NMDA} receptors to the synaptic membrane and couple it to numerous signal transduction enzymes. Recently, the authors reported that the {NMDA} receptor subunits {NR(1)} and {NR(2C)} are abnormally expressed in the thalamus in schizophrenia. They hypothesized that this reduction is associated with specific {NR(1)} isoforms and that {NMDA} receptor-related postsynaptic density proteins are abnormally expressed. {METHOD} Using in situ hybridization, the authors examined expression of the transcripts encoding {NR(1)} isoforms containing exons 5, 21, or 22, and the {NMDA} receptor-related postsynaptic density proteins {NF-L}, {PSD93}, {PSD95}, and {SAP102.} {RESULTS} Reduced {NR(1)} subunit transcript expression was restricted to exon 22-containing isoforms. Increased expression of the {NMDA} receptor-associated postsynaptic density proteins {NF-L}, {PSD95}, and {SAP102} was also detected in the thalamus of subjects with schizophrenia. {CONCLUSIONS} These data support the hypothesis of glutamatergic abnormalities in schizophrenia and suggest that glutamatergic dysfunction may occur not only at the level of receptor expression but also within intracellular pathways associated with glutamate receptor-associated signal transduction.},

  abstract  = {Numerous studies have described structural and functional abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia, but surprisingly few studies have examined neurochemical abnormalities that accompany these pathological changes. We previously identified abnormalities of multiple molecules associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission, including changes in {NMDA} receptor subunit transcripts and binding sites and {NMDA} receptor-associated post-synaptic density {(PSD)} protein transcripts in the thalamus of elderly patients with schizophrenia. In the present study, we performed western blot analysis to determine whether protein levels of {NMDA} receptor subunits {(NR1}, {NR2A}, {NR2B)} and associated {PSD} proteins {(NF-L}, {PSD95}, {SAP102)} are altered in schizophrenia. Thalamic tissue from each subject was grossly dissected into two regions: a dorsomedial region containing limbic-associated dorsomedial, anterior and central medial thalamic nuclei; and a ventral thalamus region that primarily consisted of the ventral lateral nucleus. We observed increased protein expression of the {NR2B} {NMDA} receptor subunit and its associated intracellular protein, {PSD95}, in the dorsomedial thalamus of patients with schizophrenia, but the other molecules were unchanged, and we found no changes in the ventral thalamus. These data provide additional evidence of thalamic neurochemical abnormalities, particularly in thalamic nuclei which project to limbic regions of the brain. Further, these findings provide additional evidence of {NMDA} receptor alterations in schizophrenia, which may play an important role in the neurobiology of the illness.},

  abstract    = {GABAergic interneurons sculpt the activity of principal cells and are themselves governed by GABAergic inputs. To determine directly some of the sources and mechanisms of this GABAergic innervation, we have used dual intracellular recordings with biocytin-filled microelectrodes and investigated synaptic interactions between pairs of interneurons in area CA1 of the adult rat hippocampus. Of four synaptically-coupled interneuron-to-interneuron cell pairs, three presynaptic cells were identified as basket cells, preferentially innervating somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells, but one differing from the other two in the laminar distribution of its dendritic and axonal fields. The fourth presynaptic interneuron was located at the border between strata lacunosum moleculare and radiatum, with axon ramifying within stratum radiatum. Action potentials evoked in all four presynaptic interneurons were found to elicit fast hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (mean amplitude 0.35 +/- 0.10 mV at a membrane potential of -59 +/- 2.8 mV) in other simultaneously recorded interneurons (n=4). In addition, three of the presynaptic interneurons were also shown to produce similar postsynaptic responses in subsequently recorded pyramidal cells (n=4). Electron microscopic evaluation revealed one of the presynaptic basket cells to form 12 synaptic junctions with the perisomatic domain (seven somatic synapses and five synapses onto proximal dendritic shafts) of the postsynaptic interneuron in addition to innervating the same compartments of randomly-selected local pyramidal cells (50\% somatic and 50\% proximal dendritic synapses, n=12). In addition, light microscopic analysis also indicated autaptic self-innervation in basket (12 of 12) and bistratified cells (six of six). Electron microscopic investigation of one basket cell confirmed six autaptic junctions made by five of its boutons. Together, these data demonstrate that several distinct types of interneuron have divergent output to both principal cells and local interneurons of the same (basket cells) or different type. The fast synaptic effects, probably mediated by GABA in both postsynaptic interneurons and principal cells are similar. These additional sources of GABA identified here in the input to GABAergic cells could contribute to the differential temporal patterning of distinct GABAergic synaptic networks.},

Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331-349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed.},

  abstract    = {1. Pyramidal neurones from layers II and III of the rat primary somatosensory cortex and cat primary visual cortex were studied in vitro. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and responses to exogenously applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its analogue baclofen were characterized. The results from rats and cats were very similar. 2. Single electrical stimuli to deep cortical layers evoked a sequence of PSPs in the resting neurone: (a) an initial, brief excitation (EPSP), (b) a short-latency, fast inhibition (the f-IPSP) and (c) a long-latency, more prolonged inhibition (the l-IPSP). The f-IPSP was accompanied by a large conductance increase (about 70-90 nS) and reversed polarity at -75 mV; the l-IPSP displayed a relatively small conductance increase (about 10-20 nS) and reversed at greater than -90 mV. 3. Focal application of GABA near the soma evoked a triphasic response when measured near the threshold voltage for action potentials: (a) the GABAhf (hyperpolarizing, fast) phase was very brief and was generated by a large conductance increase with a reversal potential of -78 mV, (b) the GABAd (depolarizing) phase also had a high conductance but reversed at -51 mV, (c) the GABAhl (hyperpolarizing, long-lasting) phase had a relatively low conductance and reversed at -70 mV. The GABAhf response was specifically localized to the soma, whereas the apical or basilar dendrites generated predominantly GABAd responses. 4. Baclofen, a selective GABAB receptor agonist, caused a small (about 2 mV), slow hyperpolarization of the resting potential, which reversed at -90 mV. Saturating baclofen doses increased membrane conductance by a maximum of about 12 nS. Baclofen depressed the amplitude and conductance of PSPs; when baclofen was focally applied near the soma. IPSPs were selectively depressed. 5. The GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline methiodide or picrotoxin (10 microM) greatly depressed f-IPSPs, but either enhanced or did not affect l-IPSPs. Concomitantly, GABAhf and GABAd responses were antagonized, leaving a more prominent GABAhl response that reversed polarity at a more negative level of -87 mV. Baclofen responses were unaffected by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Extracellular barium abolished the baclofen response, and shifted the reversal potentials of the GABAd and GABAhl responses in the positive direction; the GABAhf response was unaffected. 6. Both focal GABA and f-IPSPs strongly depressed the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurones. Each greatly increased spike threshold and abolished or vastly reduced the capacity of the cells to fire repetitively during intense stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract    = {Current evidence strongly supports the central involvement of the human medial temporal lobes (MTL) in storing and retrieving memories for recently experienced events. However, a critical remaining question regards exactly how the hippocampus and surrounding cortex represents spatiotemporal context defining an event in memory. Competing accounts suggest that this process may be accomplished by the following: (1) an overall increase in neural similarity of representations underlying spatial and temporal context, (2) a differentiation of competing spatiotemporal representations, or (3) a combination of the two processes, with different subregions performing these two functions within the MTL. To address these competing proposals, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging targeting the MTL along with a multivariate pattern similarity approach with 19 participants. While undergoing imaging, participants performed a task in which they retrieved spatial and temporal contextual representations from a recently learned experience. Results showed that successfully retrieving spatiotemporal context defining an episode involved a decrease in pattern similarity between putative spatial and temporal contextual representations in hippocampal subfields CA2/CA3/DG, whereas the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) showed the opposite pattern. These findings could not be accounted for by differences in univariate activations for complete versus partial retrieval nor differences in correlations for correct or incorrect retrieval. Together, these data suggest that the CA2/CA3/DG serves to differentiate competing contextual representations, whereas the PHC stores a comparatively integrated trace of scene-specific context, both of which likely play important roles in successful episodic memory retrieval.},

  abstract    = {Two types of GABAergic interneurone are known to express cholecystokinin-related peptides in the isocortex: basket cells, which preferentially innervate the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells; and double bouquet cells, which innervate distal dendrites and dendritic spines. In the hippocampus, cholecystokinin immunoreactivity has only been reported in basket cells. However, at least eight distinct GABAergic interneurone types terminate in the dendritic domain of CA1 pyramidal cells, some of them with as yet undetermined neurochemical characteristics. In order to establish whether more than one population of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurone exist in the hippocampus, we have performed whole-cell current clamp recordings from interneurones located in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region of developing rats. Recorded neurones were filled with biocytin to reveal their axonal targets, and were tested for the presence of pro-cholecystokinin immunoreactivity. The results show that two populations of cholecystokinin-immunoreactive interneurones exist in the CA1 area (n=15 positive cells). Cholecystokinin-positive basket cells (53\%) preferentially innervate stratum pyramidale and adjacent strata oriens and radiatum. A second population of cholecystokinin-positive cells, previously described as Schaffer collateral-associated interneurones [Vida et al. (1998) J. Physiol. 506, 755-773], have axons that ramify almost exclusively in strata radiatum and oriens, overlapping with the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway originating from CA3 pyramidal cells. Two of seven of the Schaffer collateral-associated cells were also immunopositive for calbindin. Soma position and orientation in stratum radiatum, the number and orientation of dendrites, and the passive and active membrane properties of the two cell populations are only slightly different. In addition, in stratum radiatum and its border with lacunosum of perfusion-fixed hippocampi, 31.6+/-3.8\% (adult) or 26.8+/-2.9\% (postnatal day 17-20) of cholecystokinin-positive cells were also immunoreactive for calbindin. Therefore, at least two populations of pro-cholecystokinin-immunopositive interneurones, basket and Schaffer collateral-associated cells, exist in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, and are probably homologous to cholecystokinin-immunopositive basket and double bouquet cells in the isocortex. It is not known if the GABAergic terminals of double bouquet cells are co-aligned with specific glutamatergic inputs. However, in the hippocampal CA1 area, it is clear that the terminals of Schaffer collateral-associated cells are co-stratified with the glutamatergic input from the CA3 area, with as yet unknown functional consequences. The division of the postsynaptic neuronal surface by two classes of GABAergic cell expressing cholecystokinin in both the hippocampus and isocortex provides further evidence for the uniform synaptic organisation of the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract    = {This study examines the performance of three groups of patients with epilepsy on three measures typically used to assess the integrity of the frontal lobes: the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (MWCST), verbal fluency and the Stroop test. The groups comprised sixteen patients with clearly defined hippocampal sclerosis, thirteen patients with unilateral temporal lobe seizure onset and eighteen patients with unilateral frontal lobe onset. Results demonstrated that performance on the MWCST was most compromised by hippocampal sclerosis. These patients took longer to complete the task, achieved fewer categories and made more perseverative errors than patients in the other groups. In contrast, verbal fluency and performance on the Stroop test were less affected by the presence of hippocampal sclerosis. These results have both clinical and theoretical significance. It is argued that patients with hippocampal damage perform poorly on the MWCST because of the heavy working memory requirements of the test. Cautious use of this test as a tool to localise seizure origin in patients with complex partial seizures is therefore recommended. The findings are discussed in terms of Gray's (1982) model of the hippocampus as a comparator of actions.},

Increased levels of neural noise have been demonstrated in psychotic disorders. We tested the hypothesis that neural noise could also be involved in the psychotomimetic effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), the principal active constituent of cannabis.Neural noise was indexed by measuring the level of randomness in the electroencephalogram during the prestimulus baseline period of an oddball task using Lempel-Ziv complexity, a nonlinear measure of signal randomness. The acute, dose-related effects of Δ(9)-THC on Lempel-Ziv complexity and signal power were studied in humans (n = 24) who completed 3 test days during which they received intravenous Δ(9)-THC (placebo, .015 and .03 mg/kg) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced design.Δ(9)-THC increased neural noise in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, there was a strong positive relationship between neural noise and the psychosis-like positive and disorganization symptoms induced by Δ(9)-THC, which was independent of total signal power. Instead, there was no relationship between noise and negative-like symptoms. In addition, Δ(9)-THC reduced total signal power during both active drug conditions compared with placebo, but no relationship was detected between signal power and psychosis-like symptoms.At doses that produced psychosis-like effects, Δ(9)-THC increased neural noise in humans in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, increases in neural noise were related with increases in Δ(9)-THC-induced psychosis-like symptoms but not negative-like symptoms. These findings suggest that increases in neural noise may contribute to the psychotomimetic effects of Δ(9)-THC.},

  abstract    = {Gamma (γ)-band oscillations play a key role in perception, associative learning, and conscious awareness and have been shown to be disrupted by cannabinoids in animal studies. The goal of this study was to determine whether cannabinoids disrupt γ-oscillations in humans and whether these effects relate to their psychosis-relevant behavioral effects. The acute, dose-related effects of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) on the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) were studied in humans (n=20) who completed 3 test days during which they received intravenous Δ(9)-THC (placebo, 0.015, and 0.03 mg/kg) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, and counterbalanced design. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while subjects listened to auditory click trains presented at 20, 30, and 40 Hz. Psychosis-relevant effects were measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS). Δ(9)-THC (0.03 mg/kg) reduced intertrial coherence (ITC) in the 40 Hz condition compared with 0.015 mg/kg and placebo. No significant effects were detected for 30 and 20 Hz stimulation. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between 40 Hz ITC and PANSS subscales and total scores under the influence of Δ(9)-THC. Δ(9)-THC (0.03 mg/kg) reduced evoked power during 40 Hz stimulation at a trend level. Recent users of cannabis showed blunted Δ(9)-THC effects on ITC and evoked power. We show for the first time in humans that cannabinoids disrupt γ-band neural oscillations. Furthermore, there is a relationship between disruption of γ-band neural oscillations and psychosis-relevant phenomena induced by cannabinoids. These findings add to a growing literature suggesting some overlap between the acute effects of cannabinoids and the behavioral and psychophysiological alterations observed in psychotic disorders.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 20 May 2015; doi:10.1038/npp.2015.53.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal theta-band oscillations are thought to facilitate the co-ordination of brain activity across distributed networks, including between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Impairments in hippocampus-PFC functional connectivity are implicated in schizophrenia and are associated with a polymorphism within the ZNF804A gene that shows a genome-wide significant association with schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms by which ZNF804A affects hippocampus-PFC connectivity are unknown. We used a multimodal imaging approach to investigate the impact of the ZNF804A polymorphism on hippocampal theta and hippocampal network coactivity. Healthy volunteers homozygous for the ZNF804A rs1344706 (A[risk]/C[nonrisk]) polymorphism were imaged at rest using both magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A dual-regression approach was used to investigate coactivations between the hippocampal network and other brain regions for both modalities, focusing on the theta band in the case of MEG. We found a significant decrease in intrahippocampal theta (using MEG) and greater coactivation of the superior frontal gyrus with the hippocampal network (using fMRI) in risk versus nonrisk homozygotes. Furthermore, these measures showed a significant negative correlation. Our demonstration of an inverse relationship between hippocampal theta and hippocampus-PFC coactivation supports a role for hippocampal theta in coordinating hippocampal-prefrontal activity. The ZNF804A-related differences that we find in hippocampus-PFC coactivation are consistent with previously reported associations with functional connectivity and with these changes lying downstream of altered hippocampal theta. Changes in hippocampal-PFC co-ordination, driven by differences in oscillatory activity, may be one mechanism by which ZNF804A impacts on brain function and risk for psychosis.},

Clearly, a lot more needs to be done but is clear to date that EC is not merely a throughput station providing all hippocampal subfields with sensory information, but that processing within EC contributes significantly to attention, conditioning, event and spatial cognition possibly by compressing representations that overlap in time. These are transmitted to the hippocampus, where they are differentiated again and returned to EC. Preliminary evidence for such a role, but also their possible pitfalls are summarised.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, a brief, preliminary attempt is made to frame a scientific debate about how functional responses at gamma frequencies in electrophysiological recordings (EEG, MEG, ECoG, and LFP) should be classified and interpreted. In general, are all gamma responses the same, or should they be divided into different classes according to criteria such as their spectral characteristics (frequency range and/or shape), their spatial-temporal patterns of occurrence, and/or their responsiveness under different task conditions? In particular, are the responses observed in intracranial EEG at a broad range of "high gamma" frequencies (~60-200Hz) different from gamma responses observed at lower frequencies (~30-80Hz), typically in narrower bands? And if they are different, how should they be interpreted? Does the broad spectral shape of high gamma responses arise from the summation of many different narrow-band oscillations, or does it reflect something completely different? If we are not sure, should we refer to high gamma activity as oscillations? A variety of theories have posited a mechanistic role for gamma activity in cortical function, often assuming narrow-band oscillations. These theories continue to influence the design of experiments and the interpretation of their results. Do these theories apply to all electrophysiological responses at gamma frequencies? Although no definitive answers to these questions are immediately anticipated, this paper will attempt to review the rationale for why they are worth asking and to point to some of the possible answers that have been proposed.},

  abstract    = {Synaptic plasticity is a cardinal cellular mechanism for learning and memory. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a pivotal pathway for synaptic plasticity because of its widely characterized ability to depress synaptic transmission on short- and long-term scales. Recent reports indicate that eCBs also mediate potentiation of the synapse. However it is not known how eCB signaling may support bidirectionality. Here, we combined electrophysiology experiments with mathematical modeling to question the mechanisms of eCB bidirectionality in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at corticostriatal synapses. We demonstrate that STDP outcome is controlled by eCB levels and dynamics: prolonged and moderate levels of eCB lead to eCB-mediated long-term depression (eCB-tLTD) while short and large eCB transients produce eCB-mediated long-term potentiation (eCB-tLTP). Moreover, we show that eCB-tLTD requires active calcineurin whereas eCB-tLTP necessitates the activity of presynaptic PKA. Therefore, just like glutamate or GABA, eCB form a bidirectional system to encode learning and memory.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia, a debilitating illness affecting 0.5-1\% of the world's population, is characterized by positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. The latter are the best predictor of functional outcome, though largely untreated by current pharmacotherapy; thus a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia is crucial. Higher order cognitive processes, such as working memory, are associated with θ (4-7 Hz) and γ (30-80 Hz) oscillations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and subjects with schizophrenia exhibit working memory impairments and reduced cortical θ and γ band power. Cortical θ and γ oscillations are dependent on perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons from basket cells expressing cholecystokinin (CCK(b) cells) and parvalbumin (PV(b) cells), respectively. Thus, alterations in basket cells may underlie the cortical oscillation deficits and working memory impairments in schizophrenia. Recent findings from postmortem studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with multiple molecular alterations that regulate signalling from CCK(b) and PV(b) cells. These alterations include lower CCK and cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) in CCK(b) cells, and lower glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and increased μ opioid receptor (μOR) in PV(b) cells, as well as lower GABA(A) receptor α1 subunit in pyramidal neurons postsynaptic to PV(b) cells. These changes are thought to lead to increased and decreased strength, respectively, of CCK(b) and PV(b) cell-mediated inhibition of postsynaptic pyramidal cells. Therefore, a convergence of evidence suggests a substantial shift in the relative strengths of PFC pyramidal cell inhibition from CCK(b) and PV(b) cells that may underlie cortical oscillation deficits and working memory impairments in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {A recent experimental study (Mizuseki, Sirota, Pastalkova, & Buzsaki, 2009) has shown that the temporal delays between population activities in successive entorhinal and hippocampal anatomical stages are longer (about 70-80ms) than expected from axon conduction velocities and passive synaptic integration of feed-forward excitatory inputs. We investigate via computer simulations the mechanisms that give rise to such long temporal delays in the hippocampus structures. A model of the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and CA1 microcircuits is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major cell types including granule cells, CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) and six types of interneurons: basket cells (BCs), axo-axonic cells (AACs), bistratified cells (BSCs), oriens lacunosum-moleculare cells (OLMs), mossy cells (MCs) and hilar perforant path associated cells (HC). Inputs to the network came from the entorhinal cortex (EC) (layers 2 and 3) and the medial septum (MS). The model simulates accurately the timing of firing of different hippocampal cells with respect to the theta rhythm. The model shows that the experimentally reported long temporal delays in the DG, CA3 and CA1 hippocampal regions are due to theta modulated somatic and axonic inhibition. The model further predicts that the phase at which the CA1 PCs fire with respect to the theta rhythm is determined primarily by their increased dendritic excitability caused by the decrease of the axial resistance and the A-type K(+) conductance along their dendritic trunk. The model predicted latencies by which the DG, CA3 and CA1 principal cells fire are inline with the experimental evidence. Finally, the model proposes functional roles for the different inhibitory interneurons in the retrieval of the memory pattern by the DG, CA3 and CA1 networks. The model makes a number of predictions, which can be tested experimentally, thus leading to a better understanding of the biophysical computations in the hippocampus.},

These data were compared with effects in healthy subjects reported elsewhere.Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol transiently increased 1) learning and recall deficits; 2) positive, negative, and general schizophrenia symptoms; 3) perceptual alterations; 4) akathisia, rigidity, and dyskinesia; 5) deficits in vigilance; and 6) plasma prolactin and cortisol. Schizophrenia patients were more vulnerable to Delta-9-THC effects on recall relative to control subjects. There were no serious short- or long-term adverse events associated with study participation.Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is associated with transient exacerbation in core psychotic and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. These data do not provide a reason to explain why schizophrenia patients use or misuse cannabis. Furthermore, Delta-9-THC might differentially affect schizophrenia patients relative to control subjects. Finally, the enhanced sensitivity to the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC warrants further study into whether brain cannabinoid receptor dysfunction contributes to the pathophysiology of the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoids produce a spectrum of effects in humans including euphoria, cognitive impairments, psychotomimetic effects, and perceptual alterations. The extent to which dopaminergic systems contribute to the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) remains unclear. This study evaluated whether pretreatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist altered the effects of Delta-9-THC in humans.In a 2-test-day double-blind study, 28 subjects including healthy subjects (n = 17) and frequent users of cannabis (n = 11) were administered t6b in random order followed 90 and 215 min later by fixed order intravenous administration of placebo (vehicle) and active (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta-9-THC, respectively.Consistent with previous reports, intravenous Delta-9-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects including "high." Delta-9-THC also impaired verbal recall and attention. Haloperidol pretreatment did not reduce any of the behavioral effects of Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol worsened the immediate free and delayed free and cued recall deficits produced by Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol and Delta-9-THC worsened distractibility and vigilance. Neither drug impaired performance on a motor screening task, the Stockings of Cambridge task, or the delayed match to sample task. Frequent users had lower baseline plasma prolactin levels and blunted Delta-9-THC induced memory impairments.The deleterious effects of haloperidol pretreatment on the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC are consistent with the preclinical literature in suggesting crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems. However, it is unlikely that DA D(2) receptor mechanisms play a major role in mediating the psychotomimetic and perceptual altering effects of Delta-9-THC. Further investigation is warranted to understand the basis of the psychotomimetic effects of Delta-9-THC and to better understand the crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoids induce a host of perceptual alterations and cognitive deficits in humans. However, the neural correlates of these deficits have remained elusive. The current study examined the acute, dose-related effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC) on psychophysiological indices of information processing in humans. Healthy subjects (n=26) completed three test days during which they received intravenous Δ⁹-THC (placebo, 0.015 and 0.03 mg/kg) in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized, cross-over, and counterbalanced design. Psychophysiological data (electroencephalography) were collected before and after drug administration while subjects engaged in an event-related potential (ERP) task known to be a valid index of attention and cognition (a three-stimulus auditory 'oddball' P300 task). Δ⁹-THC dose-dependently reduced the amplitude of both the target P300b and the novelty P300a. Δ⁹-THC did not have any effect on the latency of either the P300a or P300b, or on early sensory-evoked ERP components preceding the P300 (the N100). Concomitantly, Δ⁹-THC induced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective 'high' in a dose-dependent manner. Δ⁹-THC -induced reductions in P3b amplitude correlated with Δ⁹-THC-induced perceptual alterations. Lastly, exploratory analyses examining cannabis use status showed that whereas recent cannabis users had blunted behavioral effects to Δ(9)-THC, there were no dose-related effects of Δ⁹-THC on P300a/b amplitude between cannabis-free and recent cannabis users. Overall, these data suggest that at doses that produce behavioral and subjective effects consistent with the known properties of cannabis, Δ⁹-THC reduced P300a and P300b amplitudes without altering the latency of these ERPs. Cannabinoid agonists may therefore disrupt cortical processes responsible for context updating and the automatic orientation of attention, while leaving processing speed and earlier sensory ERP components intact. Collectively, the findings suggest that CB1R systems modulate top-down and bottom-up processing.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis is one of the most widely used illicit substances and there is growing interest in the association between cannabis use and psychosis. Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) the principal active ingredient of cannabis has been shown to induce psychotomimetic and amnestic effects in healthy individuals. Whether people who frequently use cannabis are either protected from or are tolerant to these effects of Delta-9-THC has not been established. In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the dose-related effects of 0, 2.5, and 5 mg intravenous Delta-9-THC were studied in 30 frequent users of cannabis and compared to 22 healthy controls. Delta-9-THC (1) produced transient psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations; (2) impaired memory and attention; (3) increased subjective effects of 'high'; (4) produced tachycardia; and (5) increased serum cortisol in both groups. However, relative to controls, frequent users showed blunted responses to the psychotomimetic, perceptual altering, cognitive impairing, anxiogenic, and cortisol increasing effects of Delta-9-THC but not to its euphoric effects. Frequent users also had lower prolactin levels. These data suggest that frequent users of cannabis are either inherently blunted in their response to, and/or develop tolerance to the psychotomimetic, perceptual altering, amnestic, endocrine, and other effects of cannabinoids.},

  abstract    = {Neurotransmitter release at most central synapses is synchronized to the timing of presynaptic action potentials. Here, we show that three classes of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition-expressing, cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing, hippocampal interneurons show highly asynchronous release in response to trains of action potentials. This asynchrony is correlated to the class of presynaptic interneuron but is unrelated to their postsynaptic cell target. Asynchronous and synchronous release from CCK-containing interneurons show a slightly different calcium dependence, such that the proportion of asynchronous release increases with external calcium concentration, possibly suggesting that the modes of release are mediated by different calcium sensors. Asynchronous IPSCs include very large (up to 500 pA/7nS) amplitude events, which persist in low extracellular calcium and strontium, showing that they result from quantal transmitter release at single release sites. Finally, we show that asynchronous release is prominent in response to trains of presynaptic spikes that mimic natural activity of CCK-containing interneurons. That asynchronous release from CCK-containing interneurons is a widespread phenomenon indicates a fundamental role for these cells within the hippocampal network that is distinct from the phasic inhibition provided by parvalbumin-containing interneurons.},

  abstract    = {Acute treatment with subanesthetic ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is widely utilized as a translational model for schizophrenia. However, how acute NMDA receptor blockade impacts on brain functioning at a systems level, to elicit translationally relevant symptomatology and behavioral deficits, has not yet been determined. Here, for the first time, we apply established and recently validated topological measures from network science to brain imaging data gained from ketamine-treated mice to elucidate how acute NMDA receptor blockade impacts on the properties of functional brain networks. We show that the effects of acute ketamine treatment on the global properties of these networks are divergent from those widely reported in schizophrenia. Where acute NMDA receptor blockade promotes hyperconnectivity in functional brain networks, pronounced dysconnectivity is found in schizophrenia. We also show that acute ketamine treatment increases the connectivity and importance of prefrontal and thalamic brain regions in brain networks, a finding also divergent to alterations seen in schizophrenia. In addition, we characterize how ketamine impacts on bipartite functional interactions between neural subsystems. A key feature includes the enhancement of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-neuromodulatory subsystem connectivity in ketamine-treated animals, a finding consistent with the known effects of ketamine on PFC neurotransmitter levels. Overall, our data suggest that, at a systems level, acute ketamine-induced alterations in brain network connectivity do not parallel those seen in chronic schizophrenia. Hence, the mechanisms through which acute ketamine treatment induces translationally relevant symptomatology may differ from those in chronic schizophrenia. Future effort should therefore be dedicated to resolve the conflicting observations between this putative translational model and schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {The existence of recurrent synaptic connections in CA3 led to the hypothesis that CA3 is an autoassociative network similar to the Hopfield networks studied by theorists. CA3 undergoes gamma frequency periodic inhibition that prevents a persistent attractor state. This argues against the analogy to Hopfield nets, in which an attractor state can be used for working memory. However, we show that such periodic inhibition allows one cycle of recurrent excitatory activity and that this is sufficient for memory retrieval (within milliseconds). Thus, gamma oscillations are compatible with a long-term autoassociative memory function for CA3. A second goal of our work was to evaluate previous methods for estimating the memory capacity (P) of CA3. We confirm the equation, P = c/a(2), where c is the probability that any two cells are recurrently connected and a is the fraction of cells representing a memory item. In applying this to CA3, we focus on CA3a, the subregion where recurrent connections are most numerous (c = 0.2) and approximate randomness. We estimate that a memory item is represented by approximately 225 of the 70,000 neurons in CA3a (a = 0.003) and that approximately 20,000 memory items can be stored. Our general conclusion is that the physiological and anatomical findings of CA3a are consistent with an autoassociative function. The nature of the information that is associated in CA3a is discussed. We also discuss how the autoassociative properties of CA3 and the heteroassociative properties of dentate synapses (linking sequential memories) form an integrated system for the storage and recall of item sequences. The recall process generates the phase precession in dentate, CA3, and entorhinal cortex.},

  abstract    = {Evidence indicates that blockade of cannabinoid receptors increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in brain cortical regions. Although it is assumed that this type of effect is mediated through CB1 receptor (CB1R) antagonism, several in vitro functional studies recently have suggested non-CB1R involvement. In addition, neither the precise neuroanatomical site nor the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are known. We thoroughly examined these issues using a combination of systemic and local administration of CB1R antagonists, different methods of in vivo microdialysis, CB1R knockout (KO) mice, tissue measurements of ACh, and immunochemistry. First, we showed that systemic injections of the CB1R antagonists N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboximide hydrochloride (SR-141716A) and N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251) dose-dependently increased hippocampal ACh efflux. Likewise, local hippocampal, but not septal, infusions of SR141716A or AM251 increased hippocampal ACh release. It is noteworthy that the stimulatory effects of systemically administered CB1R antagonists on hippocampal ACh release were completely abolished in CB1R KO mice. CB1R KO mice had similar basal but higher stress-enhanced hippocampal ACh levels compared with wild-type controls. It is interesting that dopamine D1 receptor antagonism counteracted the stimulatory effect of CB1R blockade on hippocampal ACh levels. Finally, immunohistochemical methods revealed that a high proportion of CB1R-positive nerve terminals were found in hippocampus and confirmed the colocalization of CB1 receptors with cholinergic and dopaminergic nerve terminals. In conclusion, hippocampal ACh release may specifically be controlled through CB1Rs located on both cholinergic and dopaminergic neuronal projections, and CB1R antagonism increases hippocampal ACh release, probably through both a direct disinhibition of ACh release and an indirect increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission at the D1 receptors.},

  abstract    = {The ability of phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals is consistent with the hypothesized pathologic occurrence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder. Because the psychosis caused by PCP resembles schizophrenia in all of the relevant domains of psychopathology, investigators have sought to characterize animal models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed "popping." MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors. As expected, in the current investigation statistically significant popping behavior was elicited by MK-801 in mice (T(22) = 2.16, P < 0.05). This MK-801-elicited popping was significantly attenuated by 100 mg/kg of galantamine (T(22) = 2.24, P < 0.05). The data show that nicotinic interventions can influence NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the intact mouse.},

  abstract    = {Despite the increasing body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of schizophrenia as a disconnection syndrome, studies of resting-state EEG Source Functional Connectivity (EEG-SFC) in people affected by schizophrenia are sparse. The aim of the present study was to investigate resting-state EEG-SFC in 77 stable, medicated patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) compared to 78 healthy volunteers (HV). In order to study the effect of illness duration, SCZ were divided in those with a short duration of disease (SDD; n = 25) and those with a long duration of disease (LDD; n = 52). Resting-state EEG recordings in eyes closed condition were analyzed and lagged phase synchronization (LPS) indices were calculated for each ROI pair in the source-space EEG data. In delta and theta bands, SCZ had greater EEG-SFC than HV; a higher theta band connectivity in frontal regions was observed in LDD compared with SDD. In the alpha band, SCZ showed lower frontal EEG-SFC compared with HV whereas no differences were found between LDD and SDD. In the beta1 band, SCZ had greater EEG-SFC compared with HVs and in the beta2 band, LDD presented lower frontal and parieto-temporal EEG-SFC compared with HV. In the gamma band, SDD had greater connectivity values compared with LDD and HV. This study suggests that resting state brain network connectivity is abnormally organized in schizophrenia, with different patterns for the different EEG frequency components and that EEG can be a powerful tool to further elucidate the complexity of such disordered connectivity.},

  abstract    = {Most studies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have focused on the combined type and emphasized a core problem in response inhibition. It is proposed here that the core problem in the truly inattentive type of ADHD (not simply the subthreshold combined type) is in working memory. It is further proposed that laboratory measures, such as complex-span and dual-task dichotic listening tasks, can detect this. Children with the truly inattentive type of ADHD, rather than being distractible, may instead be easily bored, their problem being more in motivation (underarousal) than in inhibitory control. Much converging evidence points to a primary disturbance in the striatum (a frontal-striatal loop) in the combined type of ADHD. It is proposed here that the primary disturbance in truly inattentive-type ADHD (ADD) is in the cortex (a frontal-parietal loop). Finally, it is posited that these are not two different types of ADHD, but two different disorders with different cognitive and behavioral profiles, different patterns of comorbidities, different responses to medication, and different underlying neurobiologies.},

  abstract  = {Glutamate released at synapses in the {CA1} region of the hippocampus escapes the synaptic cleft and activates extrasynaptic targets; it also may "spill over" into neighboring synapses and activate receptors there. Glutamate transporters in glial membranes restrict extrasynaptic diffusion, but it is unclear whether neuronal glutamate transporters also limit transmitter diffusion and receptor activation by spillover. I examined the effects of a low-affinity competitive {NMDA} receptor antagonist on {EPSCs} in acute hippocampal slices to distinguish receptors activated within active synapses from those activated by spillover. Glutamate spillover is observed between Schaffer collateral fiber synapses onto {CA1} pyramidal cells only when transporters in the postsynaptic neuron are inhibited. Because glutamate transporters operate most effectively at negative membrane potentials, these results suggest that activation of {NMDA} receptors by spillover may depend on postsynaptic activity.},

  abstract    = {Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) and depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) are two related forms of short-term synaptic plasticity of GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission, respectively. They are induced by calcium concentration increases in postsynaptic cells and are mediated by the release of a retrograde messenger, which reversibly inhibits afferent synapses via presynaptic mechanisms. We review here: 1. The evidence accumulated during the 1990s that has led to the conclusion that DSI/DSE rely on retrograde signaling. 2. The more recent research that has led to the identification of endocannabinoids as the retrograde messengers responsible for DSI/DSE. 3. The possible mechanisms by which presynaptic type 1 cannabinoid receptors reduce synaptic efficacy during DSI/DSE. 4. The possible modes of induction of DSI/DSE by physiological activity patterns, and the partially conflicting evaluations of the calcium concentration increases required for cannabinoid synthesis. 5. Finally, the relation between DSI/DSE and other forms of long- and short-term synaptic inhibition, which were more recently associated with the production of endocannabinoids by postsynaptic cells. We conclude that recent studies on DSI/DSE have uncovered a specific and original mode of action for endocannabinoids in the brain, and that they have opened new avenues to understand the role of retrograde signaling in central synapses.},

Here, we show that single {AMPA} receptor {EPSCs} at the cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell connection are mediated by both direct release of glutamate and rapid diffusion of glutamate from neighboring synapses. Immunogold localization revealed that {AMPA} receptors are located exclusively in postsynaptic densities, indicating that spillover of glutamate occurs between synaptic contacts. Spillover currents contributed half the synaptic charge and exhibited little trial-to-trial variability. We propose that spillover of glutamate improves transmission efficacy by both increasing the amplitude and duration of the {EPSP} and reducing fluctuations arising from the probabilistic nature of transmitter release.},

Understanding the neurobiology of sensory gating may provide insight into unravelling the neurobiology of information processing and to yet unanswered queries on the pathophysiology of disabling neuropsychiatric diseases. The endocannabinoid system has been linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Furthermore, cannabinoids disrupt sensory gating in animals and humans which supports the hypothesis that the disruption of sensory gating by alterations in the endocannabinoid system is a significant factor in the etiology of schizophrenia. Based on the above hypothesis this article reviews the sensory gating process in relation to the auditory conditioning-test paradigm with an emphasis on its association with the endocannabinoid system and schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {The prefrontal cortex encompasses a large and heterogeneous set of areas, whose borders have been variously mapped in different architectonic studies. Differences in cortical maps present a formidable problem in comparing data across studies and in constructing databanks on the connections and functional attributes of cortical areas. Here we used quantitative approaches to cortical mapping to investigate (i) if architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex in adult rhesus monkeys have unique profiles and (ii) if groups of architectonic areas belonging to distinct cortical types, ranging from agranular to eulaminate, have similar features. In addition, we used multidimensional analyses to see if, and how, prefrontal areas form clusters when multiple features are considered simultaneously. We used quantitative unbiased sampling procedures to estimate the areal and laminar density of neurons, glia and neurons positive for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin (CB) and calretinin (CR) among 21 prefrontal areas or subdivisions of areas. Neuronal density varied among the prefrontal cortices (range: 38 569 +/- 4078 to 58 708 +/- 2327 neurons/mm(3)); it was lowest in caudal orbitofrontal and medial areas (OPAll, OPro, 13, 24a, 32, M25) and highest in lateral prefrontal areas (subdivisions of areas 46 and 8). Neurons positive for PV were most prevalent in lateral prefrontal areas and least prevalent in caudal orbitofrontal and medial pre-frontal areas, whereas the opposite trend was noted for neurons that expressed CB. Neurons positive for CR did not show regional differences, and the density of glia showed small variations among prefrontal cortices. The differences among areas, along with differences in the thickness of individual areas and layers, were used to establish a quantitative profile for each area. The results showed that differences in the density of neurons, and the preponderance of neurons positive for PV and CB, were related to different architectonic types of areas found within the prefrontal cortex. Conventional as well as multiparameter statistical analyses distinguished at one extreme the agranular and dysgranular (limbic) cortices, which were characterized by prominent deep layers (V-VI), the lowest neuronal density, the highest ratio of glia/neurons, and the lowest density of PV and the highest for CB. At the other extreme, lateral eulaminate cortices were characterized by the highest density of neurons, a prominent granular layer IV, denser supragranular (II-III) than infragranular (V-VI) layers, and a balanced distribution of neurons positive for PV and CB. The results provide insights into potentially different rates of development or maturation of limbic and eulaminate prefrontal areas, and their differential vulnerability in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The quantitative methods used provide an objective approach to construct maps, address differences in nomenclature across studies, establish homologies in different species and provide a baseline to identify changes in pathologic conditions.},

  abstract    = {It is widely accepted that cannabinoids regulate GABA release by activation of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). Results obtained from a variety of brain regions consistently indicate that cannabinoid agonists can also reduce glutamatergic synaptic transmission. However, there are still conflicting data concerning the role of CB1 in cannabinoid-induced inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in cortical areas. Here, we provide direct evidence that activation of CB1 on terminals of principal neurons controls excitatory synaptic responses in the forebrain. In slices of the basolateral amygdala, the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and the primary somatosensory cortex of wild-type mice, application of the CB1 agonist (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone (WIN55,212-2; WIN) (5 mum) reduced evoked excitatory postsynaptic responses. In contrast, in slices obtained from conditional mouse mutants lacking CB1 in all principal forebrain neurons but not in GABAergic interneurons (CB1(f/f;CaMKIIalphaCre)), WIN no longer affected glutamatergic synaptic transmission in any of the brain regions tested. Compatible with a presynaptic mechanism, WIN did not change the sensitivity to focally uncaged l-glutamate. WIN reduced glutamatergic responses in slices obtained from mice lacking CB1 exclusively in GABAergic neurons (CB1(f/f;Dlx5/6-Cre)), thus excluding the involvement of CB1 expressed on GABAergic neurons in this effect of the drug. The present data strongly indicate that excitatory synaptic transmission in forebrain areas is directly modulated by CB1 expressed on presynaptic axon terminals originating from glutamatergic neurons.},

  abstract    = {Disturbances in cortical cannabinoid CB1 receptor signaling are well established correlates of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. Importantly, the ability of cannabinoid transmission to modulate emotional processing is functionally linked to interactions with subcortical DA systems. While considerable evidence demonstrates that CB1 receptor-mediated modulation of emotional processing and related behaviors follows a biphasic functional curve, little is known regarding how CB1 signaling within cortical networks may interact with subcortical DAergic systems involved in emotional behavior regulation. Using a combination of in vivo electrophysiological recordings and behavioral pharmacology in rats, we investigated the relationship between mPFC cannabinoid transmission, fear memory formation, and subcortical DA neuron activity patterns. We report that direct intra-mPFC CB1 activation biphasically modulates spontaneous, subcortical VTA DA neuron activity in a dose-dependent fashion; while lower doses of a CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, significantly increased spontaneous firing and bursting rates of VTA DA neurons, higher doses strongly inhibited spontaneous DA neuron activity. Remarkably, this same dose-related functional difference was observed with the regulation of fear-related emotional memory formation. Thus, lower levels of CB1 activation potentiated the emotional salience of normally subthreshold fear memory, whereas higher levels completely blocked fear memory acquisition. Furthermore, while the potentiation of subthreshold fear memory salience was blocked by DA receptor antagonism, CB1-mediated blunting of suprathreshold fear memory was rescued by intra-VTA administration of a GABAB receptor antagonist, demonstrating that reversal of GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms in the VTA can reverse the inhibitory influence of intra-PFC CB1 transmission on mesolimbic DA activity.},

  abstract    = {N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists produce schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms in healthy human subjects. Preclinical research suggests that NMDA-R antagonists interfere with the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons and alter the brain oscillations. These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to psychosis. In this investigation, we evaluated the hypothesis that the NMDA-R antagonist ketamine produces alterations in cortical functional connectivity during rest that are related to symptoms. We administered ketamine to a primary sample of 22 subjects and to an additional, partially overlapping, sample of 12 subjects. Symptoms before and after the experimental session were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In the primary sample, functional connectivity was measured via functional magnetic resonance imaging almost immediately after infusion began. In the additional sample, this assessment was repeated after 45 min of continuous ketamine infusion. Global, enhanced functional connectivity was observed at both timepoints, and this hyperconnectivity was related to symptoms in a region-specific manner. This study supports the hypothesis that pathological increases in resting brain functional connectivity contribute to the emergence of positive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia.},

In this study, we investigated the role of NMDA-Rs in the brain activation and connectivity that subserve WM. Because of its importance in WM, the lateral prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and its connections, were the focus of analyses. Healthy participants (n=22) participated in a single functional magnetic resonance imaging session. They received saline and then the NMDA-R antagonist ketamine while performing a spatial WM task. Time-course analysis was used to compare lateral prefrontal activation during saline and ketamine administration. Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was used to compare dorsolateral prefrontal connectivity during the two conditions and global-based connectivity was used to test for laterality in these effects. Ketamine reduced accuracy on the spatial WM task and brain activation during the encoding and early maintenance (EEM) period of task trials. Decrements in task-related activation during EEM were related to performance deficits. Ketamine reduced connectivity in the DPFC network bilaterally, and region-specific reductions in connectivity were related to performance. These results support the hypothesis that NMDA-Rs are critical for WM. The knowledge gained may be helpful in understanding disorders that might involve glutamatergic deficits such as schizophrenia and developing better treatments.},

  abstract    = {Low-frequency (delta/theta) oscillations in the thalamocortical system are elevated in schizophrenia during wakefulness and are also induced in the N-methyl-D-asparate receptor hypofunction rat model. To determine whether abnormal delta oscillations might produce functional deficits, we used optogenetic methods in awake rats. We illuminated channelrhodopsin-2 in the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) at delta frequency and measured the effect on working memory (WM) performance (the RE is involved in WM, a process affected in schizophrenia [SZ]).We injected RE with adeno-associated virus to transduce cells with channelrhodopsin-2. An optical fiber was implanted just dorsal to the hippocampus in order to illuminate RE axon terminals.During optogenetic delta frequency stimulation, rats displayed a strong WM deficit. On the following day, performance was normal if illumination was omitted.The optogenetic experiments show that delta frequency stimulation of a thalamic nucleus is sufficient to produce deficits in WM. This result supports the hypothesis that delta frequency bursting in particular thalamic nuclei has a causal role in producing WM deficits in SZ. The action potentials in these bursts may "jam" communication through the thalamus, thereby interfering with behaviors dependent on WM. Studies in thalamic slices using the N-methyl-D-asparate receptor hypofunction model show that delta frequency bursting is dependent on T-type Ca(2+) channels, a result that we confirmed here in vivo. These channels, which are strongly implicated in SZ by genome-wide association studies, may thus be a therapeutic target for treatment of SZ.},

  abstract    = {A major challenge in neuroscience is to determine the nanoscale position and quantity of signaling molecules in a cell type- and subcellular compartment-specific manner. We developed a new approach to this problem by combining cell-specific physiological and anatomical characterization with super-resolution imaging and studied the molecular and structural parameters shaping the physiological properties of synaptic endocannabinoid signaling in the mouse hippocampus. We found that axon terminals of perisomatically projecting GABAergic interneurons possessed increased CB1 receptor number, active-zone complexity and receptor/effector ratio compared with dendritically projecting interneurons, consistent with higher efficiency of cannabinoid signaling at somatic versus dendritic synapses. Furthermore, chronic Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol administration, which reduces cannabinoid efficacy on GABA release, evoked marked CB1 downregulation in a dose-dependent manner. Full receptor recovery required several weeks after the cessation of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol treatment. These findings indicate that cell type-specific nanoscale analysis of endogenous protein distribution is possible in brain circuits and identify previously unknown molecular properties controlling endocannabinoid signaling and cannabis-induced cognitive dysfunction.},

  abstract    = {Clinical brain imaging and postmortem studies provide evidence of structural and functional abnormalities of key limbic and cortical structures in depressed patients, suggesting that spine synapse connectivity is altered in depression. Characterization of the cellular determinants underlying these changes in patients are limited, but studies in rodent models demonstrate alterations of dendrite complexity and spine density and function that could contribute to the morphological and functional alterations observed in humans. Rodent studies demonstrate region specific effects in chronic stress models of depression, including reductions in dendrite complexity and spine density in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) but increases in the basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Alterations of spine synapse connectivity in these regions are thought to contribute to the behavioral symptoms of depression, including disruption of cognition, mood, emotion, motivation, and reward. Studies of the mechanisms underlying these effects demonstrate a role for altered brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling that regulates synaptic protein synthesis. In contrast, there is evidence that chronic antidepressant treatment can block or reverse the spine synapse alterations caused by stress. Notably, the new fast acting antidepressant ketamine, which produces rapid therapeutic actions in treatment resistant MDD patients, rapidly increases spine synapse number in the PFC of rodents and reverses the effects of chronic stress. The rapid synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine occur via increased BDNF regulation of synaptic protein synthesis. Together these studies provide evidence for a neurotophic and synaptogenic hypothesis of depression and treatment response and indicate that spine synapse connectivity in key cortical and limbic brain regions is critical for control of mood and emotion.},

Typical monoamine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants have only modest efficacy and require long-term treatment, and are only weakly effective in blocking or reversing these structural changes caused by stress. Recent findings demonstrate that ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant actions in difficult to treat depressed patients. In addition, preclinical studies demonstrate that ketamine rapidly increases synaptic connections in the prefrontal cortex by increasing glutamate signaling and activation of pathways that control the synthesis of synaptic proteins. Moreover, ketamine rapidly reverses the synaptic deficits caused by exposure to chronic stress in rodent models. Studies of the signaling mechanisms underlying the actions of ketamine have provided novel approaches and targets for new rapid acting antidepressants with decreased side effects, as well as a better understanding of the neurobiology of stress, depression, and treatment response.},

  abstract    = {Despite the complexity and heterogeneity of mood disorders, basic and clinical research studies have begun to elucidate the pathophysiology of depression and to identify rapid, efficacious antidepressant agents. Stress and depression are associated with neuronal atrophy, characterized by loss of synaptic connections in key cortical and limbic brain regions implicated in depression. This is thought to occur in part via decreased expression and function of growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. These structural alterations are difficult to reverse with typical antidepressants. However, recent studies demonstrate that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that produces rapid antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant depressed patients, rapidly increases spine synapses in the PFC and reverses the deficits caused by chronic stress. This is thought to occur by disinhibition of glutamate transmission, resulting in a rapid but transient burst of glutamate, followed by an increase in BDNF release and activation of downstream signaling pathways that stimulate synapse formation. Recent work demonstrates that the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, are also associated with increased glutamate transmission and synapse formation. These findings have resulted in testing and identification of additional targets and agents that influence glutamate transmission and have rapid antidepressant actions in rodent models and in clinical trials. Together these studies have created tremendous excitement and hope for a new generation of rapid, efficacious antidepressants.Abstract available from the publisher.Abstract available from the publisher.},

  abstract    = {Molecular and cellular studies have demonstrated opposing actions of stress and antidepressant treatment on the expression of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in limbic structures of the brain. These changes in neurotrophic factor expression and function result in structural alterations, including regulation of neurogenesis, dendrite length and spine density in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The deleterious effects of stress could contribute to the reduced volume of these brain regions in depressed patients. Conversely, the actions of antidepressant treatment could be mediated in part by blocking or reversing the atrophy caused by stress and depression. Recent studies have identified a novel, rapid-acting antidepressant, ketamine, in treatment-resistant depressed patients that addresses the limitations of currently available agents (i.e. delayed onset of action and low response rates). We have found that ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, causes a rapid induction of synaptogenesis and spine formation in the PFC via stimulation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin signalling pathway and increased synthesis of synaptic proteins. These effects of ketamine rapidly reverse the atrophy of PFC neurons caused by chronic stress and correspond to rapid behavioural actions of ketamine in models of depression. Characterization of a novel signalling pathway also identifies new cellular targets that could result in rapid and efficacious antidepressant actions without the side effects of ketamine.},

  abstract    = {Currently available medications have significant limitations, most notably low response rate and time lag for treatment response. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist produces a rapid antidepressant response (within hours) and is effective in treatment resistant depressed patients. Molecular and cellular studies in rodent models demonstrate that ketamine rapidly increases synaptogenesis, including increased density and function of spine synapses, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Ketamine also produces rapid antidepressant actions in behavioral models of depression, and reverses the deficits in synapse number and behavior resulting from chronic stress exposure. These effects of ketamine are accompanied by stimulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased levels of synaptic proteins. Together these studies indicate that ketamine rapidly reverses the atrophy of spines in the PFC and thereby causes a functional reconnection of neurons that underlies the rapid behavioral responses. These findings identify new targets for rapid acting antidepressants that are safer than ketamine. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and Depression'.},

Central to this hypothesis is that area CA1 performs this calculation. However, empirical evidence for this is lacking. To test the theoretical role of area CA1 in match/mismatch detection, we had subjects study complex stimuli and then, during high-resolution fMRI scanning, make memory judgments about probes that either matched or mismatched expectations. More than any other hippocampal subfield, area CA1 displayed responses consistent with a match/mismatch detector. Specifically, the responses in area CA1 tracked the total number of changes present in the probe. Additionally, area CA1 was sensitive to both behaviorally relevant and irrelevant changes, a key feature of an automatic comparator. These results are consistent with, and provide the first evidence in humans for, the theoretically important role of area CA1 as a match/mismatch detector.},

  abstract    = {Sensory circuits use common strategies, such as convergence and divergence, typically at different synapses, to pool or distribute inputs. Inputs from different presynaptic cell types converge onto a common postsynaptic cell, acting together to shape neuronal output (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008). Also, individual presynaptic cells contact several postsynaptic cell types, generating divergence of signals. Attaining such complex wiring patterns relies on the orchestration of many events across development, including axonal and dendritic growth and synapse formation and elimination (reviewed by Waites et al., 2005; Sanes and Yamagata, 2009). Recent work has focused on how distinct presynaptic cell types form stereotypic connections with an individual postsynaptic cell (Morgan et al., 2011; Williams et al., 2011), but how a single presynaptic cell type diverges to form distinct wiring patterns with multiple postsynaptic cell types during development remains unexplored. Here we take advantage of the compactness of the visual system's first synapse to observe development of such a circuit in mouse retina. By imaging three types of postsynaptic bipolar cells and their common photoreceptor targets across development, we found that distinct bipolar cell types engage in disparate dendritic growth behaviors, exhibit targeted or exploratory approaches to contact photoreceptors, and adhere differently to the synaptotropic model of establishing synaptic territories. Furthermore each type establishes its final connectivity patterns with the same afferents on separate time scales. We propose that such differences in strategy and timeline could facilitate the division of common inputs among multiple postsynaptic cell types to create parallel circuits with diverse function.},

  abstract    = {Antidepressants that produce rapid and robust effects, particularly for severely ill patients, represent one of the largest unmet medical needs for the treatment of depression. Currently available drugs that modulate monoamine neurotransmission provide relief for only a subset of patients, and this minimal efficacy requires several weeks of chronic treatment. The recent discovery that the glutamatergic agent ketamine produces rapid antidepressant responses within hours has opened a new area of research to explore the molecular mechanisms through which ketamine produces these surprising responses. Clinical and preclinical findings have exposed some of the unique actions of ketamine and identified a cell-signaling pathway known as the mammalian target of rapamycin. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin and increased synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex are crucial in mediating the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Importantly, the synaptic actions of ketamine allow rapid recovery from the insults produced by exposure to repeated stress that cause neuronal atrophy and loss of synaptic connections. In the following review, we explore some of the clinical and preclinical findings that have thrust ketamine to the forefront of rapid antidepressant research and unveiled some of its unique molecular and cellular actions.},

Here we use chronic multicircuit neurophysiological recordings to characterize functional interactions across cortical and limbic circuits in mice engineered to express a human loss-of-function depression allele Tph2-(R441H) [Tph2 knockin (Tph2KI)]. Our results show that Tph2KI mice exhibit increased intra-network synchrony within medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basal amygdala (AMY) and increased inter-network synchrony between these two brain networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that chronic treatment with fluoxetine reverses several of the circuit alterations observed within Tph2KI mice. Together, our findings establish a functional link between functional hyposerotonergia and altered mPFC–AMY network dynamics.},

The current study examined whether neural oscillations evoked by the paired clicks (S1, S2) are associated with abnormal P50 gating reported in cannabis users. Seventeen heavy cannabis users and 16 cannabis naïve controls participated. Analyses included P50 amplitudes, and time-frequency analyses (event-related spectral perturbations, ERSPs; intertrial coherence, ITC). Consistent with prior studies, cannabis users exhibited reduced P50 gating. The ERSP analysis yielded attenuated high frequency activity in the beta range (13-29 Hz) post-S1 and in the gamma range (30-50 Hz) post-S2 in the cannabis group, compared with the control group. Greater levels of cannabis use were positively associated with high P50 ratios and negatively with post-S2 ERSP gamma power. Findings suggest that heavy cannabis use is associated with aberrant beta and gamma activity in the dual-click procedure, which corroborates recent work demonstrating disruption of beta/gamma by cannabinoid receptor (CB1) agonists in a rat analogue of this task and highlights the translational potential of the dual-click procedure [corrected]},

  abstract    = {Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC) has profound effects on higher cognitive functions, and exposure to Delta9-THC has been associated with the appearance or exacerbation of the clinical features of schizophrenia. These actions appear to be mediated via the CB1 receptor, the principal cannabinoid receptor expressed in the brain. However, the distribution of the CB1 receptor in neocortical regions of the primate brain that mediate cognitive functions is not known. We therefore investigated the immunocytochemical localization of the CB1 receptor in the brains of macaque monkeys and humans using antibodies that specifically recognize the N- or C-terminus of the CB1 receptor. In monkeys, intense CB1 immunoreactivity was observed primarily in axons and boutons. Across neocortical regions of the monkey brain, CB1-immunoreactive (IR) axons exhibited considerable heterogeneity in density and laminar distribution. Neocortical association regions, such as the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, demonstrated a higher density, and exhibited a unique laminar pattern of CB1-IR axons, compared with primary sensory and motor cortices. Similar regional and laminar distributions of CB1-IR axons were also present in the human neocortex. CB1-IR axons had more prominent varicosities in human tissue, but this difference appeared to represent a postmortem effect as similar morphological features increased in unperfused monkey tissue as a function of postmortem interval. In electron microscopy studies of perfused monkey prefrontal cortex, CB1 immunoreactivity was predominantly found in axon terminals that exclusively formed symmetric synapses. The high density, distinctive laminar distribution, and localization to inhibitory terminals of CB1 receptors in primate higher-order association regions suggests that the CB1 receptor may play a critical role in the circuitry that subserves cognitive functions such as those that are disturbed in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Exposure to cannabis impairs cognitive functions reliant on the circuitry of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and increases the risk of schizophrenia. The actions of cannabis are mediated via the brain cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R), which in rodents is heavily localized to the axon terminals of cortical GABA basket neurons that contain cholecystokinin (CCK). Differences in the laminar distribution of CB1R-immunoreactive (IR) axons have been reported between rodent and monkey neocortex, suggesting that the cell type(s) containing CB1Rs, and the synaptic targets of CB1R-IR axon terminals, may differ across species; however, neither the relationship of CB1Rs to CCK-containing interneurons, nor the postsynaptic targets of CB1R and CCK axon terminals, have been examined in primate DLPFC. Consequently, we compared the distribution patterns of CB1R- and CCK-IR structures, determined the proportions of CB1R and CCK neurons that were dual-labeled, and identified the synaptic types and postsynaptic targets of CB1R- and CCK-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey DLPFC. By light microscopy, CB1R- and CCK-IR axons exhibited a similar laminar distribution, with their greatest densities in layer 4. Dual-label fluorescence experiments demonstrated that 91\% of CB1R-IR neurons were immunopositive for CCK, whereas only 51\% of CCK-IR neurons were immunopositive for CB1R. By electron microscopy, all synapses formed by CB1R-IR axon terminals were symmetric, whereas CCK-IR axon terminals formed both symmetric (88\%) and asymmetric (12\%) synapses. The primary postsynaptic target of both CB1R- and CCK-IR axon terminals forming symmetric synapses was dendritic shafts (81-88\%), with the remainder targeting cell bodies or dendritic spines. Thus, despite species differences in laminar distribution, CB1Rs are principally localized to CCK basket neuron axons in both rodent neocortex and monkey DLPFC. These axons target the perisomatic region of pyramidal neurons, providing a potential anatomical substrate for the impaired function of the DLPFC associated with cannabis use and schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a protein implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism. To date, most of research examining DISC1 function has focused on its role in neurodevelopment, despite its presence throughout life. DISC1 also regulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling by increasing type 4 phosphodiesterase catabolism of cAMP when cAMP concentrations are high. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that DISC1, through its regulation of cAMP, modulates I-SK and I-TRPC channel-mediated ionic currents that we have shown previously to regulate the activity of mature prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons.We used patch-clamp recordings in prefrontal cortical slices from adult rats in which DISC1 function was reduced in vivo by short hairpin RNA viral knockdown or in vitro by dialysis of DISC1 antibodies.We found that DISC1 disruption resulted in an increase of metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) waves, small-conductance K(+) (SK)-mediated hyperpolarization and a decrease of transient receptor potential C (TRPC)-mediated sustained depolarization. Consistent with a role for DISC1 in regulation of cAMP signaling, forskolin-induced cAMP production also increased intracellular Ca(2+) waves, I-SK and decreased I-TRPC. Lastly, inhibiting cAMP generation with guanfacine, an α2A-noradrenergic agonist, normalized the function of SK and TRPC channels.Based on our findings, we propose that diminished DISC1 function, such as occurs in some mental disorders, can lead to the disruption of normal patterns of prefrontal cortex activity through the loss of cAMP regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) waves, SK and TRPC channel activity.},

  abstract    = {Community-based studies suggest that cannabis products that are high in Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but low in cannabidiol (CBD) are particularly hazardous for mental health. Laboratory-based studies are ideal for clarifying this issue because THC and CBD can be administered in pure form, under controlled conditions. In a between-subjects design, we tested the hypothesis that pre-treatment with CBD inhibited THC-elicited psychosis and cognitive impairment. Healthy participants were randomised to receive oral CBD 600 mg (n=22) or placebo (n=26), 210 min ahead of intravenous (IV) THC (1.5 mg). Post-THC, there were lower PANSS positive scores in the CBD group, but this did not reach statistical significance. However, clinically significant positive psychotic symptoms (defined a priori as increases ≥ 3 points) were less likely in the CBD group compared with the placebo group, odds ratio (OR)=0.22 (χ²=4.74, p<0.05). In agreement, post-THC paranoia, as rated with the State Social Paranoia Scale (SSPS), was less in the CBD group compared with the placebo group (t=2.28, p<0.05). Episodic memory, indexed by scores on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Task-revised (HVLT-R), was poorer, relative to baseline, in the placebo pre-treated group (-10.6 ± 18.9\%) compared with the CBD group (-0.4\% ± 9.7 \%) (t=2.39, p<0.05). These findings support the idea that high-THC/low-CBD cannabis products are associated with increased risks for mental health.},

  abstract    = {The structure of the mammalian hippocampus continues to be modified throughout life by continuous addition of neurons in the dentate gyrus. Although the existence of adult neurogenesis is now widely accepted the function that adult generated granule cells play is a topic of intense debate. Many studies have argued that adult generated neurons, due to unique physiological characteristics, play a unique role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. However, it is not currently clear whether this is the case or what specific capability adult generated neurons may confer that developmentally generated neurons do not. These questions have been addressed in numerous ways, from examining the effects of increasing or decreasing neurogenesis to computational modeling. One particular area of research has examined the effects of hippocampus dependent learning on proliferation, survival, integration and activation of immature neurons in response to memory retrieval. Within this subfield there remains a range of data showing that hippocampus dependent learning may increase, decrease or alternatively may not alter these components of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Determining how and when hippocampus-dependent learning alters adult neurogenesis will help to further clarify the role of adult generated neurons. There are many variables (such as age of immature neurons, species, strain, sex, stress, task difficulty, and type of learning) as well as numerous methodological differences (such as marker type, quantification techniques, apparatus size etc.) that could all be crucial for a clear understanding of the interaction between learning and neurogenesis. Here, we review these findings and discuss the different conditions under which hippocampus-dependent learning impacts adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus.},

They are particularly useful in identifying the various subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons that control output from prefrontal and cingulate cortices as well as from the hippocampus. The strategic role these interneurons play in regulating output from these three crucial brain regions has made them a focus for neuropathological investigation in schizophrenia. The number of pathological reports detailing subtle changes in these CBP-containing interneurons in patients with schizophrenia is rapidly growing. These proteins however are more than convenient neuronal markers. They confer survival advantages to neurons and can increase the neuron's ability to sustain firing. These properties may be important in the subtle pathophysiology of nondegenerative phenomena such as schizophrenia. The aim of this review is to introduce the reader to the functional properties of CBPs and to examine the emerging literature reporting alterations in these proteins in schizophrenia as well as draw some conclusions about the significance of these findings.},

Volumes of the whole hippocampal formation (P < 0.01), the whole pyramidal band (P < 0.001) and the hippocampal segments CA1/CA2 (P < 0.01), CA3 (P < 0.05), CA4 (P < 0.01) were decreased, whereas no significant volume reduction of the alveus and fimbria hippocampi and presubiculum/subiculum could be found. The perforant path showed a trend towards volume reduction (P < 0.1). The absolute number of pyramidal cells (tissue volume × cell density) was diminished in CA1/CA2 (P < 0.05), CA3 (P < 0.05) and CA4 (P < 0.05), but was not significantly changed in the prosubiculum/subiculum, the presubiculum/parasubiculum and the granular cell layer of the dentate fascia. Pyramidal cell loss in CA1/CA2, CA3, CA4 was more distinct in the paranoid patients than in catatonics.

However, there is growing evidence that low concentrations of ambient GABA can persistently activate certain subtypes of GABA(A) receptor, which are often remote from synapses, to generate a 'tonic' conductance. In this review, we consider the distinct roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptor subtypes in the control of neuronal excitability.},

Thus, it remains unclear if significant cognitive impairments exist in the absence of medication. This is the first meta-analysis of cognitive findings in drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive data from 23 studies encompassing 1106 patients and 1385 controls published from 1992 to 2013 were included. Tests were to a large extent ordered in cognitive domains according to the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) battery. Analysis was performed with STATA using the random-effects model and heterogeneity as well as Egger's publication bias was assessed. Overall the results show that patients performed worse than healthy controls in all cognitive domains with medium to large effect sizes. Verbal memory, speed of processing and working memory were three of the domains with the greatest impairments. The pattern of results is in line with previous meta-analytic findings in antipsychotic treated patients. The present meta-analysis confirms the existence of significant cognitive impairments at the early stage of the illness in the absence of antipsychotic medication.},

  abstract    = {Cognitive dysfunction is considered a core feature of schizophrenia, and impaired performances in episodic memory (EM) and executive function (EF) tasks are consistently reported in schizophrenia patients. Traditional fMRI and EEG studies have helped identifying brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in these tasks. However, it is unclear whether intrinsic defects in prefrontal function per se contribute to poor performance in schizophrenia, given the presence of confounds like reduced motivation and psychotic symptoms. TMS/hd-EEG measurements are obtained without cognitive effort, and can be calculated in any cortical area.We performed TMS/hd-EEG recordings in parietal, motor, premotor, and PFC in healthy individuals (N=20) and schizophrenia patients (N=20). Source modeling of TMS-evoked responses was performed, and measures of cortical activity (significant current density, SCD) and connectivity (significant current scattering, SCS) were computed. Patients with schizophrenia also performed Penn Word memory delayed (CPWd) and Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET). CPWd evaluates EM and involves primarily PFC, whereas PCET reflects EF and implicates PFC with other brain regions.We found no difference in SCD and SCS after TMS of parietal/motor cortices, whereas those parameters were reduced in premotor/prefrontal areas in schizophrenia patients. In PFC, where these measures were most defective, SCD was negatively correlated with performance in CPWd whereas higher SCS values were associated with more errors in PCET.These findings indicate that schizophrenia patients have intrinsic defects in both activity and connectivity of PFC, and that these defects are specifically associated with impairments in cognitive abilities.},

  abstract    = {The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays a critical role in glutamatergically mediated neurotransmission, and thereby affects a wide range of brain circuits and important behavioral functions, not limited to learning and memory. While glutamate is classically considered to be the brain's principal excitatory neurotransmitter, there is also evidence the NMDAR plays a "functionally inhibitory" role, not in that it directly hyperpolarizes neurons but rather it suppresses circuit level neural activity, including through activation of GABAergic interneurons. This paper reviews data on the NMDAR "suppression" hypothesis (while also examining circuit level activation), with a focus on the following 6 lines of evidence: (1) epilepsy studies, (2) neurotoxicity studies, (3) mouse knockout studies of particular receptor subunits, (4) electrophysiological studies, (5) 2-deoxyglucose studies, and (6) functional brain imaging studies. For many of these lines of evidence, the review focuses on data from two well-characterized NMDAR antagonists, ketamine and phencyclidine. Also, evidence regarding the NMDAR and schizophrenia, including the psychotomimetic properties of ketamine and phencyclidine, cuts across several of the lines of evidence. The data suggest the NMDAR participates in activation, as well as widespread suppression, of circuit level neural activity, where the suppression may be particularly prominent in limbic circuits.},

  abstract    = {Recent recordings of place field activity in rodent hippocampus have revealed correlates of current, recent past, and imminent future events in spatial memory tasks. To analyze these properties, we used a brain-based device, Darwin XI, that incorporated a detailed model of medial temporal structures shaped by experience-dependent synaptic activity. Darwin XI was tested on a plus maze in which it approached a goal arm from different start arms. In the task, a journey corresponded to the route from a particular starting point to a particular goal. During maze navigation, the device developed place-dependent responses in its simulated hippocampus. Journey-dependent place fields, whose activity differed in different journeys through the same maze arm, were found in the recordings of simulated CA1 neuronal units. We also found an approximately equal number of journey-independent place fields. The journey-dependent responses were either retrospective, where activity was present in the goal arm, or prospective, where activity was present in the start arm. Detailed analysis of network dynamics of the neural simulation during behavior revealed that many different neural pathways could stimulate any single CA1 unit. That analysis also revealed that place activity was driven more by hippocampal and entorhinal cortical influences than by sensory cortical input. Moreover, journey-dependent activity was driven more strongly by hippocampal influence than journey-independent activity.},

  abstract    = {Information from many different sensory modalities converges on the medial temporal lobe in the mammalian brain, an area that is known to be involved in the formation of episodic memories. Neurons in this region, called place cells, display location-correlated activity. Because it is not feasible to record all neurons using current electrophysiological techniques, it is difficult to address the mechanisms by which different sensory modalities are combined to form place field activity. To address this limitation, this paper presents an embodied neural simulation of the medial temporal lobe and other cortical structures, in which all aspects of the model can be examined during a maze navigation task. The neural simulation has realistic neuroanatomical connectivity. It uses a rate code model where a single neuronal unit represents the local field potential of a pool of neurons. The dynamics of these neuronal units are based on measured neurophysiological parameters. The model is embodied in a mobile device with multiple sensory modalities. Neural activity and behavior are analyzed both in the normal condition and after sensory lesions. Place field activity arose in the model through plasticity, and it continued even when one or more sensory modalities were lesioned. An analysis that traced through all neural circuits in the model revealed that many different pathways led to the same place activity, i.e., these pathways were degenerate. After sensory lesions, the pathways leading to place activity had even greater degeneracy, but more of this variance occurred in entorhinal cortex and sensory areas than in hippocampus. This model predicts that when examining neurons causing place activity in rodents, hippocampal neurons are more likely than entorhinal or sensory neurons to maintain involvement in the circuit after sensory deprivation.},

Here, we present evidence from paired recording experiments that cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of GABA release depends on the firing rates of the presynaptic interneurons. Low-frequency action potentials in post hoc identified cholecystokinin-positive CA1 basket cells elicited IPSCs in the postsynaptic pyramidal cells that, as expected, were fully abolished by the exogenous application of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 [R-(+)-(2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrol[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl)(1-naphthalenyl) methanone monomethanesulfonate] at 5 microM. However, the presynaptic basket cells recovered from the cannabinoid agonist-induced inhibition of GABA release when the presynaptic firing rate was increased to > or =20 Hz. Pharmacological experiments showed that the recovered transmission was exclusively dependent on presynaptic N-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, the increased presynaptic firing could also overcome even complete depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, indicating that the magnitude of DSI markedly depends on the activity levels of basket cells. These results reveal a new locus of activity-dependent modulation for endocannabinoid signaling and suggest that endocannabinoid-mediated inhibition of GABA release may differ in distinct behavioral states.},

  abstract   = {Failure of corollary discharge, a mechanism for distinguishing self-generated from externally generated percepts, has been posited to underlie certain positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including auditory hallucinations. Although originally described in the visual system, corollary discharge may exist in the auditory system, whereby signals from motor speech commands prepare auditory cortex for self-generated speech. While associated with sensorimotor systems, it might also apply to inner speech or thought, regarded as our most complex motor act. In this paper, we describe the results of a series of studies in which we have shown that: (1) event-related brain potentials {(ERPs)} can be used to demonstrate the corollary discharge phenomenon during talking, (2) corollary discharge is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia, (3) {EEG} gamma band coherence between frontal and temporal lobes is greater during talking than listening and is disrupted by distorted feedback during talking in normals, and (4) patients with schizophrenia do not show this pattern for {EEG} gamma coherence. While these studies have identified {ERPs} and {EEG} gamma coherence indices of the efference copy/corollary discharge system and documented abnormalities in these systems in patients with schizophrenia, we have so far had limited success in establishing a relationship between these neurobiologic indicators of corollary discharge abnormality and reports of hallucinations in patients.},

Recent hemodynamic imaging studies have suggested that amphetamines may modulate the prefrontal and anterior cingulate brain regions, although few studies have been published and the results have not been entirely consistent. Meanwhile, several electrophysiological studies have shown that abnormal fast oscillations (in the γ range) may be closely linked to inattention and other cardinal symptoms of ADHD. In this study, we utilized magnetoencephalography to examine how amphetamines modulate high-frequency brain activity in adults with ADHD. Participants performed an auditory attention task, which required sustained attention in one block and passive listening in a separate block. Participants completed the task twice in the on-medication and off-medication states. All data were analyzed using beamforming techniques to resolve cortical regions showing event-related synchronizations and desynchronizations. Our primary findings indicated that oral administration of amphetamine decreased γ-band event-related desynchronization activity significantly in the medial prefrontal area and decreased event-related synchronization in bilateral superior parietal areas, left inferior parietal, and the left inferior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that psychostimulants strongly modulate γ activity in frontal and parietal cortical areas, which are known to be central to the brain's core attentional networks.},

  abstract    = {Research of cannabinoid actions was boosted in the 1990s by remarkable discoveries including identification of endogenous compounds with cannabimimetic activity (endocannabinoids) and the cloning of their molecular targets, the CB1 and CB2 receptors. Although the existence of an endogenous cannabinoid signaling system has been established for a decade, its physiological roles have just begun to unfold. In addition, the behavioral effects of exogenous cannabinoids such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the major active compound of hashish and marijuana, await explanation at the cellular and network levels. Recent physiological, pharmacological, and high-resolution anatomical studies provided evidence that the major physiological effect of cannabinoids is the regulation of neurotransmitter release via activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors located on distinct types of axon terminals throughout the brain. Subsequent discoveries shed light on the functional consequences of this localization by demonstrating the involvement of endocannabinoids in retrograde signaling at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses. In this review, we aim to synthesize recent progress in our understanding of the physiological roles of endocannabinoids in the brain. First, the synthetic pathways of endocannabinoids are discussed, along with the putative mechanisms of their release, uptake, and degradation. The fine-grain anatomical distribution of the neuronal cannabinoid receptor CB1 is described in most brain areas, emphasizing its general presynaptic localization and role in controlling neurotransmitter release. Finally, the possible functions of endocannabinoids as retrograde synaptic signal molecules are discussed in relation to synaptic plasticity and network activity patterns.},

  abstract    = {Retrograde synaptic signaling influences both short-term and long-term plasticity of the brain, in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. During the last few years it has become apparent that the endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the "endocannabinoids", fulfill an essential role in the brain as retrograde synaptic messengers, in a number of structures including the hippocampus, cerebellum and the limbic and mesocortical systems. This seminal discovery provides a cellular basis for the well known ubiquitous role of the endocannabinoids and their receptors (together, the "ECBR" system) in virtually all brain functions studied. This review will relate the anatomical distribution of the endocannabinoids and their CB1 receptors to functions of the ECBR system, as much as possible in light of the endocannabinoids as retrograde synaptic messengers. Functional implications of the high rates of co-localization with cholecystokinin (CCK), will also be considered. The most obvious function to be profoundly affected by the retrograde synaptic role of the endocannabinoids is memory. However, additional functions and dysfunctions such as reward and addiction, motor coordination, pain perception, feeding and appetite, coping with stress, schizophrenia and epilepsy will also be reviewed. Finally, the widespread presence of the ECBR system in the brain also lends a scientific basis for the development of cannabinoid-based medicines. The same ubiquity of the ECBR system however, should also be taken into consideration with respect to possible adverse side effects and addictive potential of such pharmaceutical developments.},

  abstract    = {The construction of biologically relevant neuronal models as well as model-based analysis of experimental data often requires the simultaneous fitting of multiple model parameters, so that the behavior of the model in a certain paradigm matches (as closely as possible) the corresponding output of a real neuron according to some predefined criterion. Although the task of model optimization is often computationally hard, and the quality of the results depends heavily on technical issues such as the appropriate choice (and implementation) of cost functions and optimization algorithms, no existing program provides access to the best available methods while also guiding the user through the process effectively. Our software, called Optimizer, implements a modular and extensible framework for the optimization of neuronal models, and also features a graphical interface which makes it easy for even non-expert users to handle many commonly occurring scenarios. Meanwhile, educated users can extend the capabilities of the program and customize it according to their needs with relatively little effort. Optimizer has been developed in Python, takes advantage of open-source Python modules for nonlinear optimization, and interfaces directly with the NEURON simulator to run the models. Other simulators are supported through an external interface. We have tested the program on several different types of problems of varying complexity, using different model classes. As targets, we used simulated traces from the same or a more complex model class, as well as experimental data. We successfully used Optimizer to determine passive parameters and conductance densities in compartmental models, and to fit simple (adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire) neuronal models to complex biological data. Our detailed comparisons show that Optimizer can handle a wider range of problems, and delivers equally good or better performance than any other existing neuronal model fitting tool.},

Microelectrode recordings have characterized the activation of single neurons and fMRI has unveiled brain-wide activation patterns. Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

  abstract    = {The observation that antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, transiently induce symptoms of acute schizophrenia had led to a paradigm shift from dopaminergic to glutamatergic dysfunction in pharmacological models of schizophrenia. The glutamate hypothesis can explain negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia better than the dopamine hypothesis, and has the potential to explain dopamine dysfunction itself. The pharmacological and psychomimetic effects of ketamine, which is safer for human subjects than phencyclidine, are herein reviewed. Ketamine binds to a variety of receptors, but principally acts at the NMDAR, and convergent genetic and molecular evidence point to NMDAR hypofunction in schizophrenia. Furthermore, NMDAR hypofunction can explain connectional and oscillatory abnormalities in schizophrenia in terms of both weakened excitation of inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons that synchronize cortical networks and disinhibition of principal cells. Individuals with prenatal NMDAR aberrations might experience the onset of schizophrenia towards the completion of synaptic pruning in adolescence, when network connectivity drops below a critical value. We conclude that ketamine challenge is useful for studying the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, dopaminergic and GABAergic dysfunction, age of onset, functional dysconnectivity, and abnormal cortical oscillations observed in acute schizophrenia.},

We have identified a type of slow-spiking interneuron that offers distinct contributions to network activity. "Ivy" cells, named after their dense and fine axons innervating mostly basal and oblique pyramidal cell dendrites, are more numerous than the parvalbumin-expressing basket, bistratified, or axo-axonic cells. Ivy cells express nitric oxide synthase, neuropeptide Y, and high levels of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit; they discharge at a low frequency with wide spikes in vivo, yet are distinctively phase-locked to behaviorally relevant network rhythms including theta, gamma, and ripple oscillations. Paired recordings in vitro showed that Ivy cells receive depressing EPSPs from pyramidal cells, which in turn receive slowly rising and decaying inhibitory input from Ivy cells. In contrast to fast-spiking interneurons operating with millisecond precision, the highly abundant Ivy cells express presynaptically acting neuromodulators and regulate the excitability of pyramidal cell dendrites through slowly rising and decaying GABAergic inputs.},

Using retrograde tracer injections in the subiculum, we identified a hippocampal population of ENK-expressing projection neurons. In situ hybridization for GAD shows that ENK-expressing cells are a small GABAergic subpopulation. Furthermore, by extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling in vivo, we identified an ENK-expressing cell in stratum radiatum of the CA1 area by its complete axodendritic arborization and characteristic spike timing during network oscillations. The somatodendritic membrane was immunopositive for mGluR1alpha, and there was both a rich local axon in CA1 and subicular-projecting branches. The boutons showed cell-type- and layer-specific innervation, i.e., interneurons were the main targets in the alveus, both interneurons and pyramidal cell dendrites were innervated in the other layers, and interneurons were exclusive targets in the subiculum. Parvalbumin-, but not somatostatin-, calbindin-, or cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons were preferred synaptic targets. During network activity, the juxtacellularly labeled ENK-expressing cell was phase modulated throughout theta oscillations, but silenced during sharp-wave/ripple episodes. After these episodes the interneuron exhibited rebound activity of high-frequency spike bursts, presumably causing peptide release. The ENK-expressing interneurons innervating parvalbumin-positive interneurons might contribute to the organization of the sharp-wave/ripple episodes by decreased firing during and rebound activity after the ripple episodes, as well as to the coordination of activity between the CA1 and subicular areas during network oscillations.},

We studied in vitro in CA1 pyramidal neurons the contribution of AMPA and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) components of Schaffer collateral (SC) excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs; EPSP(AMPA) and EPSP(NMDA)) and of the back-propagating action potential (BAP) to the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a STDP protocol that consisted in pairing an EPSP and a BAP. Transient blockade of EPSP(AMPA) with 7-nitro-2,3-dioxo-1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-6-carbonitrile (CNQX) during the STDP protocol prevented LTP. Contrastingly LTP was induced under transient inhibition of EPSP(AMPA) by combining SC stimulation, an imposed EPSP(AMPA)-like depolarization, and BAP or by coupling the EPSP(NMDA) evoked under sustained depolarization (approximately -40 mV) and BAP. In Mg(2+)-free solution EPSP(NMDA) and BAP also produced LTP. Suppression of EPSP(NMDA) or BAP always prevented LTP. Thus activation of NMDA receptors and BAPs are needed but not sufficient because AMPA receptor activation is also obligatory for STDP. However, a transient depolarization of another origin that unblocks NMDA receptors and a BAP may also trigger LTP.},

  abstract    = {Cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) are considered core symptoms of this disorder, and can manifest at the prodromal stage. Antipsychotics ameliorate positive symptoms but only modestly improve cognitive symptoms. The lack of treatments that improve cognitive abilities currently represents a major obstacle in developing more effective therapeutic strategies for this debilitating disorder. While D4 receptor (D4R)-specific antagonists are ineffective in the treatment of positive symptoms, animal studies suggest that D4R drugs can improve cognitive deficits. Moreover, recent work from our group suggests that D4Rs synergize with the neuregulin/ErbB4 signaling pathway, genetically identified as risk factors for SCZ, in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons to modulate gamma oscillations. These high-frequency network oscillations correlate with attention and increase during cognitive tasks in healthy subjects, and this correlation is attenuated in affected individuals. This finding, along with other observations indicating impaired GABAergic function, has led to the idea that abnormal neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in individuals with SCZ reflects a perturbation in the balance of excitation and inhibition. Here we review the current state of knowledge of D4R functions in the PFC and hippocampus, two major brain areas implicated in SCZ. Special emphasis is given to studies focusing on the potential role of D4Rs in modulating GABAergic transmission and to an emerging concept of a close synergistic relationship between dopamine/D4R and neuregulin/ErbB4 signaling pathways that tunes the activity of PV interneurons to regulate gamma frequency network oscillations and potentially cognitive processes.},

Although recent studies have helped provide a better understanding of the neurofunctional correlates of these effects, indicating the involvement of the amygdala and cingulate cortex, their reciprocal influence is still mostly unknown. In this study dynamic causal modelling (DCM) and Bayesian model selection (BMS) were used to explore the effects of pure compounds of C. sativa [600 mg of cannabidiol (CBD) and 10 mg Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta 9-THC)] on prefrontal-subcortical effective connectivity in 15 healthy subjects who underwent a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled fMRI paradigm while viewing faces which elicited different levels of anxiety. In the placebo condition, BMS identified a model with driving inputs entering via the anterior cingulate and forward intrinsic connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate as the best fit. CBD but not Delta 9-THC disrupted forward connectivity between these regions during the neural response to fearful faces. This is the first study to show that the disruption of prefrontal-subocritical connectivity by CBD may represent neurophysiological correlates of its anxiolytic properties.},

The neurophysiological substrates of these effects are unknown.To investigate the effects of 2 main psychoactive constituents of Cannabis sativa (Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol [Delta9-THC] and cannabidiol [CBD]) on regional brain function during emotional processing.Subjects were studied on 3 separate occasions using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm while viewing faces that implicitly elicited different levels of anxiety. Each scanning session was preceded by the ingestion of either 10 mg of Delta9-THC, 600 mg of CBD, or a placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design.Fifteen healthy, English-native, right-handed men who had used cannabis 15 times or less in their life.Regional brain activation (blood oxygenation level-dependent response), electrodermal activity (skin conductance response [SCR]), and objective and subjective ratings of anxiety.Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol increased anxiety, as well as levels of intoxication, sedation, and psychotic symptoms, whereas there was a trend for a reduction in anxiety following administration of CBD. The number of SCR fluctuations during the processing of intensely fearful faces increased following administration of Delta9-THC but decreased following administration of CBD. Cannabidiol attenuated the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in the amygdala and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex while subjects were processing intensely fearful faces, and its suppression of the amygdalar and anterior cingulate responses was correlated with the concurrent reduction in SCR fluctuations. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol mainly modulated activation in frontal and parietal areas.Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD had clearly distinct effects on the neural, electrodermal, and symptomatic response to fearful faces. The effects of CBD on activation in limbic and paralimbic regions may contribute to its ability to reduce autonomic arousal and subjective anxiety, whereas the anxiogenic effects of Delta9-THC may be related to effects in other brain regions.},

  abstract    = {Anatomical studies have shown that the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1) is selectively expressed in a subset of GABAergic interneurons. It has been proposed that these cells regulate rhythmic activity and play a key role mediating the cognitive actions of marijuana and endogenous cannabinoids. However, the physiology, anatomy, and synaptic connectivity of neocortical CB1-expressing interneurons remain poorly studied. We identified a population of CB1-expressing interneurons in layer II/III in mouse neocortical slices. These cells were multipolar or bitufted, had a widely extending axon, and exhibited a characteristic pattern of irregular spiking (IS) in response to current injection. CB1-expressing-IS (CB1-IS) cells were inhibitory, establishing GABAA receptor-mediated synapses onto pyramidal cells and other CB1-IS cells. Recently, electrical coupling among other classes of cortical interneurons has been shown to contribute to the generation of rhythmic synchronous activity in the neocortex. We therefore tested whether CB1-IS interneurons are interconnected via electrical synapses using paired recordings. We found that 90\% (19 of 21 pairs) of simultaneously recorded pairs of CB1-IS cells were electrically coupled. The average coupling coefficient was 6\%. Signaling through electrical synapses promoted coordinated firing among CB1-IS cells. Together, our results identify a population of electrically coupled CB1-IS GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex that share a unique morphology and a characteristic pattern of irregular spiking in response to current injection. The synaptic interactions of these cells may play an important role mediating the cognitive actions of cannabinoids and regulating coherent neocortical activity.},

  abstract    = {Distinct networks of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons connected by electrical synapses can promote different patterns of activity in the neocortex. Cannabinoids affect memory and cognition by powerfully modulating a subset of inhibitory synapses; however, very little is known about the synaptic properties of the cannabinoid receptor-expressing neurons (CB(1)-positive irregular spiking [CB(1)-IS]) in the neocortex. Using paired recordings in neocortical slices, we 1st report here that synapses of CB(1)-IS cells, but not synapses of fast-spiking (FS) cells, are suppressed by release of endocannabinoids from pyramidal neurons. CB(1)-IS synapses were characterized by a very high failure rate that contrasted with the high reliability of FS synapses. Furthermore, CB(1)-IS cells received excitatory inputs less frequently compared with FS cells and made significantly less frequent inhibitory contacts onto local pyramids. These distinct synaptic properties together with their characteristic irregular firing suggest that CB(1)-IS cells play different role in neocortical function than that of FS cells. Thus, whereas the synaptic properties of FS cells can allow them to impose high-frequency rhythmic oscillatory activity, those of CB(1)-IS cells may lead to disruption of fast rhythmic oscillations. Our results suggest that activity-dependent release of cannabinoids, by blocking CB(1)-IS synapses, may alter the role of inhibition in neocortical circuits.},

Thus, understanding molecular influences on PFC function through basic research in animals is essential to rational drug development. In this review, we discuss the molecular signaling events initiated by norepinephrine and dopamine that strengthen working memory function mediated by the dorsolateral PFC under optimal conditions, and weaken working memory function during uncontrollable stress. We also discuss how these intracellular mechanisms can be compromised in psychiatric disorders, and how novel treatments based on these findings may restore a molecular environment conducive to PFC regulation of behavior, thought and emotion. Examples of successful translation from animals to humans include guanfacine for the treatment of ADHD and related PFC disorders, and prazosin for the treatment of PTSD.},

In particular, it plagues our ability to acquire, process, and model high-dimensional data sets. Moreover, neural systems must cope with the challenge of processing data in high dimensions to learn and operate successfully within a complex world. We review recent mathematical advances that provide ways to combat dimensionality in specific situations. These advances shed light on two dual questions in neuroscience. First, how can we as neuroscientists rapidly acquire high-dimensional data from the brain and subsequently extract meaningful models from limited amounts of these data? And second, how do brains themselves process information in their intrinsically high-dimensional patterns of neural activity as well as learn meaningful, generalizable models of the external world from limited experience?},

  abstract   = {{OBJECTIVE} Multiple quantifiable biologic abnormalities have been localized to the hippocampus in schizophrenia. Alterations in glutamate-mediated transmission at {N-methyl-D-aspartic} acid {(NMDA)-sensitive} receptors in hippocampus have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the illness. The authors tested the hypothesis that glutamatergic transmission within and efferent from hippocampus is altered in schizophrenia. {METHOD} The authors analyzed postmortem hippocampal tissue from individuals with schizophrenia and from healthy individuals. The tissue samples had been collected by two brain tissue banks, one in Maryland and the other in Melbourne, Australia. lonotropic receptor binding for the {NMDA}, kainate, and {(3)H-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-propionate} {(AMPA)} receptors was quantified by using usual radioligand techniques. In situ hybridization autoradiography was used to quantify {mRNA} for the {NMDA} receptor subunits {NR1}, {NR2A}, and {NR2B.} {RESULTS} Ligand binding to the ionotropic glutamate receptors {(NMDA}, kainate, and {AMPA)} did not differ significantly overall or in any subregion between the schizophrenia tissue and the healthy comparison tissue. The only exception was {AMPA} receptor binding in hippocampal subregion {CA2}, which was slightly but significantly less in schizophrenia. However, the level of {mRNA} for the {NMDA} receptor subunits {NR1} and {NR2B} was significantly different between groups; in several hippocampal subregions, the level of {NR1} {mRNA} was lower and the level of {NR2B} {mRNA} higher in schizophrenia. {CONCLUSIONS} Because the {NR1} subunit of the {NMDA} receptor is critical to full receptor activity, a reduction of {NR1} in hippocampus in schizophrenia suggests a functional impairment in glutamatergic transmission at the {NMDA} receptor, resulting in reduced glutamatergic transmission within and possibly efferent from the hippocampus in schizophrenia. This defect could underlie a hypoglutamatergic state in regions of limbic cortex, consistent with published results from other lines of research in schizophrenia.},

Areas covered: Recent (post 2013) phase III clinical trials of schizophrenia-targeted therapies were found in US and EU clinical trial registries. Two hundred fifty-three trials were identified, that included 16 investigational compounds. The antipsychotics brexpiprazole and cariprazine have been approved in the US, and although both are dopamine D2 receptor partial agonists, they differ markedly in their pharmacodynamic profiles. Encenicline and valbenazine are first-in-class candidates for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) and tardive dyskinesia, respectively. Eleven add-on compounds were previously approved for other therapeutic indications and are for the most part being studied at academic medical centers and smaller pharmaceutical companies for negative symptoms and CIAS or for specific populations (comorbidities, antipsychotic-induced obesity). Expert opinion: Promising new agents are emerging for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. In addition to better-tolerated antipsychotics that treat positive symptoms, we could see the arrival of the first effective drug for negative symptoms and CIAS, which would strongly facilitate the ultimate goal of recovery in persons with schizophrenia.},

Although tracing studies have suggested changes in amygdala–cortical connectivity through the adolescent period in rodents, less is known about the reciprocal connections within this circuitry across human development, when these circuits are being fine-tuned and substantial changes in emotional control are observed. The present study examined developmental changes in amygdala–prefrontal circuitry across the ages of 4–22 years using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results suggest positive amygdala–prefrontal connectivity in early childhood that switches to negative functional connectivity during the transition to adolescence. Amygdala–medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity was significantly positive (greater than zero) among participants younger than 10 years, whereas functional connectivity was significantly negative (less than zero) among participants 10 years and older, over and above the effect of amygdala reactivity. The developmental switch in functional connectivity was paralleled by a steady decline in amygdala reactivity. Moreover, the valence switch might explain age-related improvement in task performance and a developmentally normative decline in anxiety. Initial positive connectivity followed by a valence shift to negative connectivity provides a neurobiological basis for regulatory development and may present novel insight into a more general process of developing regulatory connections.},

  abstract    = {Synaptic inhibition plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of neuronal networks and selecting cell assemblies. Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10-20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches. The functional implications of such a connectivity pattern are not well understood. Our experimentally based theoretical study highlights several new and counterintuitive principles for dendritic inhibition. We show that distal "off-path" rather than proximal "on-path" inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic "hotspots," thus powerfully controlling the neuron's output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic contacts, inhibition operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Consequently, inhibition in regions lacking inhibitory synapses may exceed that at the synaptic sites themselves.

  abstract    = {Synaptic inhibition plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of neuronal networks and selecting cell assemblies. Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10-20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches. The functional implications of such a connectivity pattern are not well understood. Our experimentally based theoretical study highlights several new and counterintuitive principles for dendritic inhibition. We show that distal "off-path" rather than proximal "on-path" inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic "hotspots," thus powerfully controlling the neuron's output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic contacts, inhibition operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Consequently, inhibition in regions lacking inhibitory synapses may exceed that at the synaptic sites themselves. These results offer new insights into the synergetic effect of dendritic inhibition in controlling dendritic excitability and plasticity and in dynamically molding functional dendritic subdomains and their output.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoids act at the CB1 receptor to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. Within the striatum, CB1 receptors have been shown to be localized on the same neurons as Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptors. In this study we have examined the interactions of CB1 and D2 receptors on adenylate cyclase. In striatal neurons in primary culture, both the CB1 receptor agonist [3-(1, 1-dimethylheptyl)-11-hydroxy-Delta8tetrahydrocannabinol] (HU210) and the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation when applied separately. In contrast, HU210 and quinpirole in combination augmented cAMP accumulation. This augmentation was blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A or the D2 antagonist sulpride. Pertussis toxin treatment of striatal neurons prevented the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by D2 receptors but unmasked a cannabinoid receptor-mediated stimulatory effect on cAMP accumulation. The cannabinoid receptor-stimulated accumulation of cAMP was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by SR141716A, suggesting that the response was regulated through the CB1 receptor. Similar augmentation of cAMP accumulation after pertussis toxin treatment was observed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with, and stably expressing, the CB1 receptor. This stimulation of cAMP was not Ca2+-sensitive and was unaffected by a range of protein kinase inhibitors. Treatment of the pertussis toxin-treated cells with cholera toxin before CB1 receptor activation amplified the stimulatory pathway, suggesting that this response was mediated through a Gs-type G-protein. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation was not observed after pertussis toxin treatment of CHO cells expressing the human CB2 receptor, suggesting that this novel signaling pathway is unique to the cannabinoid CB1 receptor.},

  abstract    = {Cortical circuitry dysfunction in schizophrenia has been studied at many different levels of resolution, but not at the most basic unit of network organization--synaptic inputs. Multi-label electron or confocal light microscopy is required to examine specific types of synaptic inputs, and application of these methods to quantitatively study disease-related changes in human postmortem tissue has not been feasible for technical reasons. We recently developed a multi-label confocal light microscopic approach that makes possible the systematic identification and quantification of synaptic inputs, and of the relative levels of proteins localized to these inputs, in human postmortem tissue. We applied this approach to quantify parvalbumin basket cell (PVBC) inputs in area 9 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from schizophrenia and matched comparison subjects. Tissue sections were triple-labeled for the 65 kD isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), PV and the GABA(A) receptor α1 subunit. PVBC axonal boutons were defined as PV/GAD65 dual-labeled puncta, and PVBC inputs were defined as a PVBC bouton that overlapped a GABA(A) receptor α1 subunit punctum. The density of PVBC inputs was unchanged in subjects with schizophrenia, but levels of PV protein were lower in PVBC boutons. In concert with prior reports, these findings indicate that PVBC dysfunction in schizophrenia reflects molecular and not structural alterations in these cells and their axon terminals.},

Here we found that the spike timing of CB1R-expressing basket cells, a major target for cannabinoids in the rat hippocampus, was distinct from the other main group of basket cells, the CB1R-negative. Despite receiving the same afferent inputs, the synaptic and biophysical properties of the two cell types were tuned to detect different features of activity. CB1R-negative basket cells responded reliably and immediately to subtle and repetitive excitation. In contrast, CB1R-positive basket cells responded later and did not follow repetitive activity, but were better suited to integrate the consecutive excitation of independent afferents. This temporal separation in the activity of the two basket cell types generated distinct epochs of somatic inhibition that were differentially affected by endocannabinoids.},

  abstract    = {Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in conjunction with post hoc anatomy we investigated the physiological properties of hippocampal stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale inhibitory interneurones, before and following the induction of pharmacologically evoked gamma frequency network oscillations. Prior to kainate-induced transient epochs of gamma activity, two distinct classes of oriens interneurones, oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) and trilaminar cells, showed prominent differences in their membrane and firing properties, as well as in the amplitude and kinetics of their excitatory postsynaptic events. In the active network both types of neurone received a phasic barrage of gamma frequency excitatory inputs but, due to their differential functional integration, showed clear differences in their output patterns. While O-LM cells fired intermittently at theta frequency, trilaminar interneurones discharged on every gamma cycle and showed a propensity to fire spike doublets. Two other classes of fast spiking interneurones, perisomatic targeting basket and bistratified cells, in the active network discharged predominantly single action potentials on every gamma cycle. Thus, within a locally excited network, O-LM cells are likely to provide a theta-frequency patterned output to distal dendritic segments, whereas basket and bistratified cells are involved in the generation of locally synchronous gamma band oscillations. The anatomy and output profile of trilaminar cells suggest they are involved in the projection of locally generated gamma rhythms to distal sites. Therefore a division of labour appears to exist whereby different frequencies and spatiotemporal properties of hippocampal rhythms are mediated by different interneurone subtypes.},

  abstract    = {Prefrontal dysfunction has been associated with schizophrenia. Activation during Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) is a common approach used in functional neuroimaging to address this failure. Equally, current knowledge states that oscillations are basic forms of cells-assembly communications during mental activity. Promising results were revealed in a previous study assessing healthy subjects, WCST and oscillations. However, those previous studies failed to meet the functional integration of the network during the WCST in schizophrenics, based on the induced oscillations and their distributed cortical sources. In this research, we utilized the brain electrical tomography (variable-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) technique to accomplish this goal. Task specific delta, theta, alpha and beta-2 oscillations were induced and simultaneously synchronized over large extensions of cortex, encompassing prefrontal, temporal and posterior regions as in healthy subjects. Every frequency had a well-defined network involving a variable number of areas and sharing some of them. Oscillations at 11.5, 5.0 and 30 Hz seem to reflect an abnormal increase or decrease, being located at supplementary motor area (SMA), left occipitotemporal region (OT), and right frontotemporal subregions (RFT), respectively. Three cortical areas appeared to be critical, that may lead to difficulties either in coordinating/sequencing the input/output of the prefrontal networks-SMA, and retention of information in memory-RFT, both preceded or paralleled by a deficient visual information processing-OT.},

  abstract    = {Basic visual dysfunctions are commonly reported in schizophrenia; however their value as diagnostic tools remains uncertain. This study reports a novel electrophysiological approach using checkerboard visual evoked potentials (VEP). Sources of spectral resolution VEP-components C1, P1 and N1 were estimated by LORETA, and the band-effects (BSE) on these estimated sources were explored in each subject. BSEs were Z-transformed for each component and relationships with clinical variables were assessed. Clinical effects were evaluated by ROC-curves and predictive values. Forty-eight patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 55 healthy controls participated in the study. For each of the 48 patients, the three VEP components were localized to both dorsal and ventral brain areas and also deviated from a normal distribution. P1 and N1 deviations were independent of treatment, illness chronicity or gender. Results from LORETA also suggest that deficits in thalamus, posterior cingulum, precuneus, superior parietal and medial occipitotemporal areas were associated with symptom severity. While positive symptoms were more strongly related to sensory processing deficits (P1), negative symptoms were more strongly related to perceptual processing dysfunction (N1). Clinical validation revealed positive and negative predictive values for correctly classifying SZ of 100\% and 77\%, respectively. Classification in an additional independent sample of 30 SZ corroborated these results. In summary, this novel approach revealed basic visual dysfunctions in all patients with schizophrenia, suggesting these visual dysfunctions represent a promising candidate as a biomarker for schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia is a brain disorder associated with cognitive deficits that severely affect the patients' capacity for daily functioning. Whereas our understanding of its pathophysiology is limited, postmortem studies suggest that schizophrenia is associated with deficits of GABA-mediated synaptic transmission. A major role of GABA-mediated transmission may be producing synchronized network oscillations which are currently hypothesized to be essential for normal cognitive function. Therefore, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia may result from a GABA synapse dysfunction that disturbs neural synchrony. Here, we highlight recent studies further suggesting alterations of GABA transmission and network oscillations in schizophrenia. We also review current models for the mechanisms of GABA-mediated synchronization of neural activity, focusing on parvalbumin-positive GABA neurons, which are altered in schizophrenia and whose function has been strongly linked to the production of neural synchrony. Alterations of GABA signaling that impair gamma oscillations and, as a result, cognitive function suggest paths for novel therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract    = {Spatial variability in resting functional MRI (fMRI) brain networks has not been well studied in schizophrenia, a disease known for both neurodevelopmental and widespread anatomic changes. Motivated by abundant evidence of neuroanatomical variability from previous studies of schizophrenia, we draw upon a relatively new approach called independent vector analysis (IVA) to assess this variability in resting fMRI networks. IVA is a blind-source separation algorithm, which segregates fMRI data into temporally coherent but spatially independent networks and has been shown to be especially good at capturing spatial variability among subjects in the extracted networks. We introduce several new ways to quantify differences in variability of IVA-derived networks between schizophrenia patients (SZs = 82) and healthy controls (HCs = 89). Voxelwise amplitude analyses showed significant group differences in the spatial maps of auditory cortex, the basal ganglia, the sensorimotor network, and visual cortex. Tests for differences (HC-SZ) in the spatial variability maps suggest, that at rest, SZs exhibit more activity within externally focused sensory and integrative network and less activity in the default mode network thought to be related to internal reflection. Additionally, tests for difference of variance between groups further emphasize that SZs exhibit greater network variability. These results, consistent with our prediction of increased spatial variability within SZs, enhance our understanding of the disease and suggest that it is not just the amplitude of connectivity that is different in schizophrenia, but also the consistency in spatial connectivity patterns across subjects.},

  abstract    = {Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) provides a powerful means to map the effects of drugs on brain activity, with important applications in pharmacological research. However, phMRI studies in preclinical species are often conducted under general anaesthesia as a means to avoid head motion and to minimise the stress induced by the procedure. Under these conditions, the phMRI response to the drug of interest may be affected by interactions with the anaesthetic agent, with consequences for the interpretation of the data. Here, we have investigated the phMRI response to phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDA receptor blocker, in the halothane-anaesthetised rat for varying levels of anaesthesia and different PCP challenge doses. PCP induces psychotic-like symptoms in humans and laboratory animals and is widely applied as a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. However, PCP possesses anaesthetic properties per se, and its interactions with halothane might result in significant effects on the phMRI activation patterns. We observed two qualitatively different patterns of phMRI response. At 0.5 mg/kg iv PCP and 0.8\% halothane maintenance anaesthesia, the lowest doses explored, an activation of discrete cortico-limbo-thalamic structures was observed, consistent with neuroimaging studies in humans and 2-deoxyglucose functional mapping in conscious animal models. However, higher anaesthetic concentrations or higher PCP challenge doses resulted in complete abolition of the positive response and in a widespread cortical deactivation (negative response). In the intermediate regime, we observed a dichotomic behaviour, with individual subjects showing one pattern or the other. These findings indicate a dose-dependent drug-anaesthetic interaction, with a complete reversal of the effects of PCP at higher challenge doses or HT concentrations.},

  abstract   = {High-frequency burst discharges in hippocampus typically consist of less than ten spikes fired at frequencies too high to be followed by a post-synaptic neuron. How significant are these numbers for synaptic signalling? We have measured the N-methyl-d-aspartate {(NMDA)} component of the excitatory post-synaptic current {(EPSC(NMDA))} in hippocampal {CA1} neurons of rat after burst discharge of variable duration. The synaptic facilitation is accompanied by a slow-down of the {EPSC(NMDA)} which develops on a spike-to-spike basis. Consequently the charge transferred by the after-burst {EPSC(NMDA)} is increased with each spike. The phenomenon is most probably due to the spillover-mediated recruitment of extrasynaptic {NMDA} receptors. In terms of post-synaptic signalling it dramatically increases the impact of each spike in a short burst discharge.},

In this Primer, we briefly review the general mechanisms of neuronal calcium signaling. We then introduce the calcium imaging devices, including confocal and two-photon microscopy as well as miniaturized devices that are used in freely moving animals. We provide an overview of the classical chemical fluorescent calcium indicators and of the protein-based genetically encoded calcium indicators. Using application examples, we introduce new developments in the field, such as calcium imaging in awake, behaving animals and the use of calcium imaging for mapping single spine sensory inputs in cortical neurons in vivo. We conclude by providing an outlook on the prospects of calcium imaging for the analysis of neuronal signaling and plasticity in various animal models.},

  abstract    = {The hippocampal network comprises a large variety of locally connected GABAergic interneurons exerting a powerful control on network excitability and which are responsible for the oscillatory behaviour crucial for information processing. GABAergic interneurons receive an important cholinergic innervation from the medial septum-diagonal band complex of the basal forebrain and are endowed with a variety of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs) that regulate their activity. Deficits in the cholinergic system lead to the impairment of high cognitive functions, which are particularly relevant in neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as in schizophrenia. Here, we highlight some recent advances in the mechanisms by which cholinergic signalling via nAChRs regulates local inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus, early in postnatal life and in adulthood. We also discuss recent findings concerning the functional role of nAChRs in controlling short- and long-term modifications of synaptic efficacy. Insights into these processes may provide new targets for the therapeutic control of pathological conditions associated with cholinergic dysfunctions.},

In this review of the TINS Microcircuits Special Feature, we attempt to shed light on the problem by comparing the operation of four types of microcircuit, to identify common molecular and cellular components. Central pattern generator (CPG) networks underlying rhythmic movements and hippocampal microcircuits that generate gamma and theta rhythms are compared with the neocortical microcircuits used in cognitive tasks and a cerebellar network. The long-term goal is to identify the components of a molecular and synaptic tool kit for the design of different microcircuits.},

Sensory gating can be studied by recording the brain's electrical responses to repeated clicks: the P50 potential is normally reduced to the second of two paired clicks but not in schizophrenia patients. To identify its neural correlates, we recorded electrical traces of sensory gating directly from the human hippocampus and neocortex.Intracranial evoked potentials were recorded using hippocampal depth electrodes and subdural strip and grid electrodes in 32 epilepsy patients undergoing invasive presurgical evaluation.We found evidence of sensory gating only in the hippocampus, the temporo-parietal region (Brodmann's areas 22 and 2), and the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's areas 6 and 24); however, whereas neocortical habituating responses to paired clicks were peaking around 50 msec, responses within the hippocampus proper had a latency of about 250 msec.Consistent with data from animal studies, our findings show that the hippocampus proper contributes to sensory gating, albeit during a time window following neocortical habituation processes. Thus, sensory gating may be a multistep process, with an early phase subserved by the temporo-parietal and prefrontal cortex and a later phase mediated by the hippocampus.},

Standard extracellular and intracellular recordings from in vitro brain slices of rat hippocampi were employed to show that recurrent inhibition onto CA1 neurons can be modulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. Besides reducing the amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) at resting membrane potential conditions, different NMDA antagonists, including the endogenous substance N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamic acid (NAAG), are able to block long-term potentiation (LIP) of recurrent inhibition completely at concentrations that are not sufficient to block LTP of the excitatory drive onto pyramidal neurons. This LTP of recurrent inhibition may play a significant role in stimulus discrimination and learning, as simulated in a biophysical computer model of a basic neuronal circuit. Both the amplitude of the IPSP and LTP of the recurrent inhibitory circuit also undergo developmental changes showing their highest expression and vulnerability to chronic NMDA antagonist injections in juvenile rats. Finally, blocking NMDA receptor-dependent transmission in the recurrent inhibition loop may lead to an overall increased excitability of the neuronal network. This may resemble the positive schizophrenic symptoms observed in man, presumably caused by elevated levels of the endogenous NMDA antagonist NAAG.},

The complete dendritic trees of functionally distinct interneuron types containing parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D(28k) (CB), or calretinin (CR) were reconstructed at the light microscopic level to describe their geometry, total length, and laminar distribution. Serial electron microscopic reconstruction and postembedding GABA immunostaining was then used to determine the density of GABA-negative asymmetrical (excitatory) and GABA-positive symmetrical (inhibitory) synaptic inputs on their dendrites, somata, and axon initial segments. The total convergence and the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs were then calculated using the light and electron microscopic data sets. The three populations showed characteristic differences in dendritic morphology and in the density and distribution of afferent synapses. PV cells possessed the most extensive dendritic tree (4300 microm) and the thickest dendrites. CR cells had the smallest dendritic tree (2500 microm) and the thinnest shafts. The density of inputs as well as the total number of excitatory plus inhibitory synapses was several times higher on PV cells (on average, 16,294) than on CB (3839) or CR (2186) cells. The ratio of GABAergic inputs was significantly higher on CB (29.4\%) and CR (20.71\%) cells than on PV cells (6.4\%). The density of inhibitory terminals was higher in the perisomatic region than on the distal dendrites. These anatomical data are essential to understand the distinct behavior and role of these interneuron types during hippocampal activity patterns and represent fundamental information for modeling studies.},

  abstract    = {Non-pyramidal cells were filled intracellularly with biocytin in the CA3 region of the guinea-pig hippocampus in vitro, within or close to stratum pyramidale. On the basis of camera lucida reconstructions and electron microscopy, six different cell types with distinct laminar distribution of axon terminals could be distinguished. The axon of three axo-axonic cells, three typical basket cells, and atypical basket cells of two types arborized in the perisomatic and proximal dendritic region of CA3 pyramidal cells. Two cells with axons innervating the distal dendritic segments of pyramidal cells were also found; one terminated in stratum radiatum and the other in stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Electron microscopy demonstrated that symmetrical synapses were formed by the labelled boutons on axon initial segments, somata, and proximal or distal dendrites of mostly pyramidal neurons. Axo-axonic cells showed absolute target selectivity for axon initial segments, whereas for the other cells the distribution of contacted elements was determined by the laminar distribution of axon terminals. In two cases, where additional cells were labelled with biocytin, multiple (up to nine) light microscopically identified contacts (presumed synaptic contacts) were established by the interneurons on several pyramidal cells and on an axo-axonic cell. Our results show that a restricted set of inhibitory cells, with somata within or close to CA3 stratum pyramidale, possess variable patterns of axonal arborization. Various types of postsynaptic elements are contacted, but precision in selecting certain targets and ignoring others is maintained within a particular cell type and layer. In contrast to the diversity of axonal arbors the structure of the dendritic trees shows no consistent differences, suggesting that the cells may be activated by a similar set of afferents. It seems probable that the innervation of precise regions of postsynaptic pyramidal cells by different types of interneurons--often in conjunction with particular excitatory afferents (Han et al., Eur. J. Neurosci., 5, 395-410, 1993)--underlies functional differences in inhibitory synaptic actions.},

  abstract    = {Morphologically a synapse consists of a presynaptic release site containing vesicles, a postsynaptic element with membrane specialization, and a synaptic cleft between them. The number of release sites shapes the properties of synaptic transmission between neurons. Although excitatory interactions between cortical neurons have been examined, the number of release sites remains unknown. We have now recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by single pyramidal cells in hippocampal interneurons and visualized both cells using biocytin injections. Light and electron microscopy showed that excitatory postsynaptic potentials were mediated by a single synapse. We also reconstructed the entire axon arborization of single pyramidal cells, filled in vivo, in sections counterstained for parvalbumin, which selectively marks basket and axo-axonic cells. Single synaptic contacts between pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-containing neurons were dominant (> 80\%), providing evidence for high convergence and divergence in hippocampal networks.},

  abstract    = {Gamma frequency oscillations in cortical regions can be recorded during cognitive processes, including attention or memory tasks. These oscillations are generated locally as a result of reciprocal interactions between excitatory pyramidal cells and perisomatic inhibitory interneurons. Here, we examined the contribution of the three perisomatic interneuron types--the parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking basket cells (FSBCs) and axo-axonic cells (AACs), as well as the cholecystokinin-containing regular-spiking basket cells (RSBCs) to cholinergically induced oscillations in hippocampal slices, a rhythmic activity that captures several features of the gamma oscillations recorded in vivo. By analyzing the spiking activities of single neurons recorded in parallel with local field potentials, we found that all three cell types fired phase locked to the carbachol-induced oscillations, although with different frequencies and precision. During these oscillations, FSBCs fired the most with the highest accuracy compared with the discharge of AACs and RSBCs. In further experiments, we showed that activation of μ-opioid receptors by DAMGO ([D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin acetate), which significantly reduced the inhibitory, but not excitatory, transmission, suppressed or even blocked network oscillations both in vitro and in vivo, leading to the desynchronization of pyramidal cell firing. Using paired recordings, we demonstrated that carbachol application blocked GABA release from RSBCs and reduced it from FSBCs and AACs, whereas DAMGO further suppressed the GABA release only from FSBCs, but not from AACs. These results collectively suggest that the rhythmic perisomatic inhibition, generating oscillatory fluctuation in local field potentials after carbachol treatment of hippocampal slices, is the result of periodic GABA release from FSBCs.},

  abstract    = {Auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) are reduced in schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers administered the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine. In rodents, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a stimulator of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, attenuates the cognitive and behavioral effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. On the basis of these findings, we tested whether NAC would reduce ketamine effects on behavior, MMN, and P300 in healthy humans.This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisted of 2 test days during which subjects (n = 16) were administered oral NAC (3000 mg in divided doses) or matching placebo 165 min before the infusion of saline and then ketamine (as a bolus of .23 mg/kg over 1 min followed by .58 mg/kg for 30 min, and then .29 mg/kg for 40 min) in a fixed order. Behavioral and ERP data including auditory MMN and P300 were collected during each test day.Ketamine produced psychotic-like positive symptoms, reductions in working memory and sustained attention performance, and amplitude reductions for the frequency- and intensity-deviant MMNs and P300. NAC pretreatment did not reduce the behavioral or ERP effects of ketamine. In addition, NAC reduced frequency-deviant MMN amplitude and increased target and novelty P3 amplitudes. The decrements in frequency-deviant MMN amplitude produced by ketamine and NAC were not additive.NAC did not attenuate the effects of ketamine in humans, in contrast to previous studies in animals. NAC merits further investigation as a cognitive enhancing agent due to its ability to increase the P300 amplitude.},

  abstract    = {Our earlier studies demonstrated that in the hippocampus, cannabinoids suppress inhibitory synaptic transmission via CB(1) cannabinoid receptors, whereas a novel cannabinoid-sensitive receptor modulates excitatory synapses (Katona, I. et al., Journal of Neuroscience 19 (1999) 4544; Hájos, N. et al., European Journal of Neuroscience 12 (2000) 3239; Hájos, N. et al., Neuroscience 106 (2001) 1). The novel receptor does not correspond to CB(2), since this receptor type is not expressed in the brain (Munro, S. et al., Nature 365 (1993) 61). Recent binding experiments revealed that the synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 binds with lower affinity to brain membranes of CB(1) receptor-knockout mice indicating that pharmacological differences exist between these two types of cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus (Breivogel et al., Molecular Pharmacology 60 (2001) 155). To analyze this difference in detail, we first determined the EC(50) values of WIN 55,212-2 for excitatory and inhibitory transmission in rat hippocampal slices using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The estimated EC(50) value for inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) evoked by electrical stimulation in CA1 pyramidal cells was 0.24 microM, whereas for excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) it was 2.01 microM, respectively. The cannabinoid antagonist, AM251, blocked the WIN 55,212-2-induced inhibition of evoked IPSCs, but not of EPSCs, providing evidence for its selectivity for CB(1). We then tested the hypothesis of whether the cannabinoid effect on hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission is mediated via receptors with an affinity for vanilloid ligands. Co-application of the vanilloid receptor antagonist capsazepine (10 microM) with cannabinoids (WIN55,212-2 or CP55,940) prevented the reduction of EPSCs, but not of IPSCs. The amplitude of evoked EPSCs was also suppressed by superfusion of the vanilloid receptor agonist capsaicin (10 microM), an effect which could also be antagonized by capsazepine. In contrast, capsaicin did not change the amplitude of evoked IPSCs. These results demonstrate that WIN 55,212-2 is an order of magnitude more potent in reducing GABAergic currents via CB(1) than in inhibiting glutamatergic transmission via the new CB receptor. The sensitivity of the new CB receptor (and EPSCs) to vanilloid ligands, but not to the cannabinoid antagonist AM251, represents another pharmacological tool to distinguish the two receptors, since CB(1) (and its effect on IPSCs) is not modulated by vanilloids, but is antagonized by AM251.},

  abstract    = {Psychoactive effects of cannabinoids are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by suppression of both glutamate and GABA release via CB1 cannabinoid receptor. Two types of cannabinoid receptor (CB1 and CB2) have been cloned so far. The CB1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the nervous system, whereas CB2 receptors are limited to lymphoid organs (Matsuda et al., 1990; Munro et al., 1993). Immunocytochemical and electrophysiological studies revealed that in the hippocampus CB1 receptors are expressed on axon terminals of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (Tsou et al., 1999; Katona et al., 1999) and activation of these receptors decreases GABA release (Hájos et al., 2000). Other physiological studies pointed out the involvement of CB1 receptors in the modulation of hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (Stella et al., 1997; Misner and Sullivan, 1999), but anatomical studies could not confirm the existence of CB1 receptors on glutamatergic terminals. Here we examined cannabinoid actions on both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of wild type (CB1+/+) and CB1 receptor knockout mice (CB1-/-). The synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 reduced the amplitudes of excitatory postsynaptic currents in both wild type and CB1-/- mice, while inhibitory postsynaptic currents were decreased only in wild type mice, but not in CB1-/- animals. Our findings are consistent with a CB1 cannabinoid receptor-dependent modulation of GABAergic postsynaptic currents, but a novel cannabinoid-sensitive receptor must be responsible for the inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission.},

  abstract    = {Impaired auditory gating and abnormal neuronal synchrony are indicators of dysfunctional information processing in schizophrenia patients and possible underlying mechanisms of their impaired sensory and cognitive functions. Because cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids have been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor activation on sensory gating and neuronal oscillations in rats.Auditory sensory gating has been recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) in anesthetized rats. Neuronal network oscillations were recorded from the hippocampus, medial septum, EC, and medial prefrontal cortex in anesthetized and freely moving rats. Effects of systemic administration of CB1 receptor agonist CP-55940 were evaluated on these parameters.CP-55940 significantly disrupted auditory gating both in the hippocampus and EC in anesthetized rats. Theta field potential oscillations were disrupted in the hippocampus and EC, with simultaneous interruption of theta-band oscillations of septal neurons. Administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM-251 reversed both the agonist-induced gating deficit and the diminished oscillations. In freely moving rats, CP-55940 significantly reduced theta and gamma power in the hippocampus, whereas in the EC, only gamma power was attenuated. However, novelty-induced theta and gamma activities were significantly diminished by CP-55940 in both the hippocampus and EC.Our data indicate that activation of CB1 receptors interferes with neuronal network oscillations and impairs sensory gating function in the limbic circuitry, further supporting the connection between cannabis abuse and increased susceptibility of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders.},

  abstract    = {Theta frequency oscillation of the septo-hippocampal system has been considered as a prominent activity associated with cognitive function and affective processes. It is well documented that anxiolytic drugs diminish septo-hippocampal oscillatory Theta activity contributing to their either therapeutic or unwanted side effects. In the present experiments we applied a combination of computational and physiological techniques to explore the functional role of GABAA receptors in Theta oscillation. In electrophysiological experiments extracellular single unit recordings were performed from medial septum/diagonal band of Broca with simultaneous hippocampal (CA1) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from anesthetized rats. Neurotransmission at GABAA receptors were modulated by means of pharmacological tools: the actions of the GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator diazepam and inverse agonist/negative allosteric modulator FG-7142 were evaluated on septo-hippocampal activity. Systemic administration of diazepam inhibited, whereas FG-7142 enhanced Theta oscillation of septal neurons and hippocampal EEG Theta activity. In parallel to these experimental observations, a computational model has been constructed by implementing a septal GABA neuron model with a CA1 hippocampal model containing three types of neurons (including oriens and basket interneurons and pyramidal cells; latter modeled by multicompartmental techniques; for detailed model description with network parameters see online addendum: http://geza.kzoo.edu/theta). This connectivity made the network capable of simulating the responses of the septo-hippocampal circuitry to the modulation of GABAA transmission, and the presently described computational model proved suitable to reveal several aspects of pharmacological modulation of GABAA receptors. In addition, computational findings indicated different roles of distinctively located GABAA receptors in theta generation.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenic patients are thought to have an impaired ability to process sensory information. This deficit leads to disrupted auditory gating measured electrophysiologically as a reduced suppression of the second of paired auditoryevoked responses (P50) and is proposed to be associated with decreased function and/or expression of the homomeric alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Here, we provide evidence that N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-4-chlorobenzamide hydrochloride (PNU-282987), a novel selective agonist of the alpha7 nAChR, evoked whole-cell currents from cultured rat hippocampal neurons that were sensitive to the selective alpha7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and enhanced GABAergic synaptic activity when applied to hippocampal slices. Amphetamine-induced sensory gating deficit, determined by auditory-evoked potentials in hippocampal CA3 region, was restored by systemic administration of PNU-282987 in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats. Auditory gating of rat reticular thalamic neurons was also disrupted by amphetamine; however, PNU-282987 normalized gating deficit only in a subset of tested neurons (6 of 11). Furthermore, PNU-282987 improved the inherent hippocampal gating deficit occurring in a subpopulation of anesthetized rats, and enhanced amphetamine-induced hippocampal oscillation. We propose that the alpha7 nAChR agonist PNU-282987, via modulating/enhancing hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission, improves auditory gating and enhances hippocampal oscillatory activity. These results provide further support for the concept that drugs that selectively activate alpha7 nAChRs may offer a novel, potential pharmacotherapy in treatment of schizophrenia.},

  abstract  = {{NMDA} receptors participate in the glutamatergic excitation of both principal cells and {GABAergic} interneurons. The features of {NMDA} channels on specific interneurons, however, are not known. Therefore, we obtained direct measurements of single {NMDA} receptor channels on anatomically identified oriens/alveus interneurons projecting to stratum lacunosum-moleculare {(O-LM} cells) and compared them to those found on hippocampal principal cells using cell-attached recordings in in vitro slice preparations. The recorded channels could be blocked by ketamine, a membrane-permeable {NMDA} channel inhibitor. In the absence of Mg(2+), all {O-LM} cells had {NMDA} channels with a comparable slope conductance (approximately {60pS)} to those measured on {CA1} pyramidal cells or dentate granule cells. In addition, {NMDA} channels with smaller conductance (43-45 {pS)} were also found on two {O-LM} cells but not on principal cells. These results suggest that at least two types of {NMDA} channels are expressed on {O-LM} cells likely reflecting distinct subunit composition.},

  abstract    = {To assess the position of interneurons in the hippocampal network, fast spiking cells were recorded intracellularly in vitro and filled with biocytin. Sixteen non-principal cells were selected on the basis of 1) cell bodies located in the pyramidal layer and in the middle of the slice, 2) extensive labeling of their axons, and 3) a branching pattern of the axon indicating that they were not axo-axonic cells. Examination of their efferent synapses (n = 400) demonstrated that the cells made synapses on cell bodies, dendritic shafts, spines, and axon initial segments (AIS). Statistical analysis of the distribution of different postsynaptic elements, together with published data (n = 288) for 12 similar cells, showed that the interneurons were heterogeneous with regard to the frequency of synapses given to different parts of pyramidal cells. When the cells were grouped according to whether they had less or more than 40\% somatic synaptic targets, each population appeared homogeneous. The population (n = 19) innervating a high proportion of somata (53 +/- 10\%, SD) corresponds to basket cells. They also form synapses with proximal dendrites (44 +/- 12\%) and rarely with AISs and spines. One well-filled basket cell had 8,859 boutons within the slice, covering an area of 0.331 mm2 of pyramidal layer tangentially and containing 7,150 pyramidal cells, 933 (13\%) of which were calculated to be innervated, assuming that each pyramidal cell received nine to ten synapses. It was extrapolated that the intact axon probably had about 10,800 boutons innervating 1,140 pyramids. The proportion of innervated pyramidal cells decreased from 28\% in the middle to 4\% at the edge of the axonal field. The other group of neurons, the bistratified cells (n = 9), showed a preference for dendritic shafts (79 +/- 8\%) and spines (17 +/- 8\%) as synaptic targets, rarely terminating on somata (4 +/- 8\%). Their axonal field was significantly larger (1,250 +/- 180 microns) in the medio-lateral direction than that of basket cells (760 +/- 130 microns). The axon terminals of bistratified cells were smaller than those of basket cells. Furthermore, in constrast to bistratified cells, basket cells had a significant proportion of dendrites in stratum lacunosum-moleculare suggesting a direct entorhinal input. The results define two distinct types of GABAergic neuron innervating pyramidal cells in a spatially segregated manner and predict different functions for the two inputs. The perisomatic termination of basket cells is suited for the synchronization of a subset of pyramidal cells that they select from the population within their axonal field, whereas the termination of bistratified cells in conjunction with Schaffer collateral/commissural terminals may govern the timing of CA3 input and/or voltage-dependent conductances in the dendrites.},

Studies in animal models, healthy volunteers, and psychotic patients clearly suggest an antipsychotic-like effect of cannabidiol. This study investigated the effects of cannabidiol on selective attention in 28 schizophrenic patients using the Stroop Color Word Test and on these patients' electrodermal responsiveness to auditive stimuli.The subjects attended two experimental sessions, the first one without the administration of drugs. In the second session the subjects were divided into three groups that received either a single dose of cannabidiol 300 mg or cannabidiol 600 mg or placebo.The three groups did not differ significantly with respect to electrodermal measures in the two experimental sessions. When the first and second sessions were compared improved performance was found in all three groups, with patients who received placebo and cannabidiol 300 mg performing better than those who received cannabidiol 600 mg.The single, acute administration of cannabidiol seems to have no beneficial effects on the performance of schizophrenic patients in the Stroop Color Word Test, although the hypothesis that chronic administration may lead to improvement cannot be disregarded.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoid ligands show therapeutic potential in a variety of disorders including anxiety. However, the anxiety-related effects of cannabinoids remain controversial as agonists show opposite effects in mice and rats. Here we compared the effects of the cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212 and the CB1 antagonist AM-251 in CD1 mice and Wistar rats. Special attention was paid to antagonist-agonist interactions, which had not yet been studied in rats. In mice, WIN-55,212 decreased whereas AM-251 increased anxiety. The antagonist abolished the effects of the agonist. In contrast, WIN-55,212 increased anxiety in rats. Surprisingly, the antagonist potentiated this effect. Cannabinoids affect both GABAergic and glutamatergic functions, which play opposite roles in anxiety. We hypothesized that discrepant findings resulted from species differences in the relative responsiveness of the two transmitter systems to cannabinoids. We investigated this hypothesis by studying the effects of WIN-55,212 on evoked hippocampal inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs and EPSCs). IPSCs were one order of magnitude more sensitive to WIN-55,212 in mice than in rats. In mice, IPSCs were more sensitive than EPSCs to WIN-55,212. This is the first study showing that the relative cannabinoid sensitivity of GABA and glutamate neurotransmission is species-dependent. Based on behavioural and electrophysiological findings, we hypothesize that WIN-55,212 reduced anxiety in mice by affecting GABA neurotransmission whereas it increased anxiety in rats via glutamatergic mechanisms. In rats, AM-251 potentiated this anxiogenic effect by inhibiting the anxiolytic GABAergic mechanism. We suggest that the anxiety-related effects of cannabinoids depend on the relative cannabinoid responsiveness of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.},

Whereas changes in DA neuronal firing rate were frequently observed in response to intra-amygdalar microinjection of CCK peptides, NMDA was most effective in eliciting changes in DA neuronal activity following intra-accumbal microinjection.

  abstract    = {Maintenance of cognitive control is a major concern for many human disease conditions; therefore, a major goal of human neuroprosthetics is to facilitate and/or recover the cognitive function when such circumstances impair appropriate decision making.Minicolumnar activity from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was recorded from nonhuman primates trained to perform a delayed match to sample (DMS), via custom-designed conformal multielectrode arrays that provided inter-laminar recordings from neurons in the PFC layer 2/3 and layer 5. Such recordings were analyzed via a previously demonstrated nonlinear multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) neuroprosthesis in rodents, which extracted and characterized multicolumnar firing patterns during DMS performance.The MIMO model verified that the conformal recorded individual PFC minicolumns responded to entrained target selections in patterns critical for successful DMS performance. This allowed the substitution of task-related layer 5 neuron firing patterns with electrical stimulation in the same recording regions during columnar transmission from layer 2/3 at the time of target selection. Such stimulation improved normal task performance, but more importantly, recovered performance when applied as a neuroprosthesis following the pharmacological disruption of decision making in the same task.These findings provide the first successful application of neuroprosthesis in the primate brain designed specifically to restore or repair the disrupted cognitive function.},

  abstract    = {Timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) is induced when synaptic activity is immediately followed by one or more back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) in the postsynaptic cell. As a mechanistic explanation, it has been proposed that the bAP removes the Mg2+ block of synaptic NMDA receptors, allowing for rapid Ca2+ entry at the active synapse. Recent experimental studies suggest that this model is incomplete: NMDA receptor-based coincidence detection requires strong postsynaptic depolarization, usually provided by AMPA receptor currents. Apparently, the brief AMPA-EPSP does not only enable t-LTP, it is also responsible for the very narrow time window for t-LTP induction. The emerging consensus puts the spine in the center of coincidence detection, as active conductances on the spine together with the electrical resistance of the spine neck regulate the depolarization of the spine head and thus Ca2+ influx during pairing. A focus on postsynaptic voltage during synaptic activation not only encompasses spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), but explains also the cooperativity and frequency-dependence of plasticity.},

  abstract    = {Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons project to diverse cortical and hippocampal areas and receive reciprocal projections therefrom. Maintenance of a fine-tuned synaptic communication between pre- and postsynaptic cells in neuronal circuitries also requires feedback mechanisms to control the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal. Release of endocannabinoids or glutamate from a postsynaptic neuron has been identified as a means of retrograde synaptic signalling. Presynaptic action of endocannabinoids is largely mediated by type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors, while fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is involved in inactivating some endocannabinoids postsynaptically. Alternatively, vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) controls release of glutamate from postsynaptic cells. Here, we studied the distribution of CB1 receptors, FAAH and VGLUT3 in cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei of mouse and rat. Cholinergic neurons were devoid of CB1 receptor immunoreactivity. A fine CB1 receptor-immunoreactive (ir) fibre meshwork was present in medial septum, diagonal bands and nucleus basalis. In contrast, the ventral pallidum and substantia innominata received dense CB1 receptor-ir innervation and cholinergic neurons received CB1 receptor-ir presumed synaptic contacts. Consistent with CB1 receptor distribution, FAAH-ir somata were abundant in basal forebrain and appeared in contact with CB1 receptor-containing terminals. Virtually all cholinergic neurons were immunoreactive for FAAH. A significant proportion of cholinergic cells exhibited VGLUT3 immunoreactivity in medial septum, diagonal bands and nucleus basalis, and were in close apposition to VGLUT3-ir terminals. VGLUT3 immunoreactivity was largely absent in ventral pallidum and substantia innominata. We propose that specific subsets of cholinergic neurons may utilize endocannabinoids or glutamate for retrograde control of the efficacy of input synapses, and the mutually exclusive complementary distribution pattern of CB1 receptor-ir and VGLUT3-ir fibres in basal forebrain suggests segregated input-specific signalling mechanisms by cholinergic neurons.},

However, neither the conditions necessary for triggering complex spikes, nor their computational function are well understood. CA1 pyramidal cell burst activity was examined in behaving rats. The fraction of bursts was not reliably higher in place field centers, but rather in places where discharge frequency was 6-7 Hz. Burst probability was lower and bursts were shorter after recent spiking activity than after prolonged periods of silence (100 ms-1 s). Burst initiation probability and burst length were correlated with extracellular spike amplitude and with intracellular action potential rising slope. We suggest that bursts may function as "conditional synchrony detectors," signaling strong afferent synchrony after neuronal silence, and that single spikes triggered by a weak input may suppress bursts evoked by a subsequent strong input.},

  abstract    = {Similarities in neocortical circuit organization across areas and species suggest a common strategy to process diverse types of information, including sensation from diverse modalities, motor control and higher cognitive processes. Cortical neurons belong to a small number of main classes. The properties of these classes, including their local and long-range connectivity, developmental history, gene expression, intrinsic physiology and in vivo activity patterns, are remarkably similar across areas. Each class contains subclasses; for a rapidly growing number of these, conserved patterns of input and output connections are also becoming evident. The ensemble of circuit connections constitutes a basic circuit pattern that appears to be repeated across neocortical areas, with area- and species-specific modifications. Such 'serially homologous' organization may adapt individual neocortical regions to the type of information each must process.},

In the present study, we used a within-participant double-blind design to evaluate the effects acute marijuana smoking on complex cognitive performance in experienced marijuana smokers. Eighteen healthy research volunteers (8 females, 10 males), averaging 24 marijuana cigarettes per week, completed this three-session outpatient study; sessions were separated by at least 72-hrs. During sessions, participants completed baseline computerized cognitive tasks, smoked a single marijuana cigarette (0\%, 1.8\%, or 3.9\% Delta(9)-THC w/w), and completed additional cognitive tasks. Blood pressure, heart rate, and subjective effects were also assessed throughout sessions. Marijuana cigarettes were administered in a double-blind fashion and the sequence of Delta(9)-THC concentration order was balanced across participants. Although marijuana significantly increased the number of premature responses and the time participants required to complete several tasks, it had no effect on accuracy on measures of cognitive flexibility, mental calculation, and reasoning. Additionally, heart rate and several subjective-effect ratings (e.g., "Good Drug Effect," "High," "Mellow") were significantly increased in a Delta(9)-THC concentration-dependent manner. These data demonstrate that acute marijuana smoking produced minimal effects on complex cognitive task performance in experienced marijuana users.},

  abstract    = {The medial prefrontal cortex is involved in working memory and executive control. However, the collective spatiotemporal organization of the cellular network has not been possible to explain during different brain states. We show that pyramidal cells in the prelimbic cortex fire synchronized to hippocampal theta and local spindle oscillations in anesthetized rats. To identify which types of interneurons contribute to the synchronized activity, we recorded and juxtacellularly labeled parvalbumin- and calbindin-expressing (PV+/CB+) basket cells and CB-expressing, PV-negative (CB+/PV-) dendrite-targeting interneurons during both network oscillations. All CB+/PV- dendrite-targeting cells strongly decreased their firing rate during hippocampal theta oscillations. Most PV+/CB+ basket cells fired at the peak of dorsal CA1 theta cycles, similar to prefrontal pyramidal cells. We show that pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus also fire around the peak of dorsal CA1 theta cycles, in contrast to previously reported dorsal hippocampal pyramidal cells. Therefore, prefrontal neurons might be driven by monosynaptic connections from the ventral hippocampus during theta oscillations. During prefrontal spindle oscillations, the majority of pyramidal cells and PV+/CB+ basket cells fired preferentially at the trough and early ascending phase, but CB+/PV- dendrite-targeting cells fired uniformly at all phases. We conclude that PV+/CB+ basket cells contribute to rhythmic responses of prefrontal pyramidal cells in relation to hippocampal and thalamic inputs and CB+/PV- dendrite-targeting cells modulate the excitability of dendrites and spines regardless of these field rhythms. Distinct classes of GABAergic interneuron in the prefrontal cortex contribute differentially to the synchronization of pyramidal cells during network oscillations.},

  abstract    = {In subjects with schizophrenia, impairments in working memory are associated with dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This dysfunction appears to be due, at least in part, to abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory circuitry. To test the hypothesis that altered GABA-mediated circuitry in the DLPFC of subjects with schizophrenia reflects expression changes of genes that encode selective presynaptic and postsynaptic components of GABA neurotransmission, we conducted a systematic expression analysis of GABA-related transcripts in the DLPFC of 14 pairs of schizophrenia and age-, sex- and post-mortem interval-matched control subjects using a customized DNA microarray with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Subjects with schizophrenia exhibited expression deficits in GABA-related transcripts encoding (1) presynaptic regulators of GABA neurotransmission (67 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD(67)) and GABA transporter 1), (2) neuropeptides (somatostatin (SST), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and cholecystokinin (CCK)) and (3) GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha4, beta3, gamma2 and delta). Real-time qPCR and/or in situ hybridization confirmed the deficits for six representative transcripts tested in the same pairs and in an extended cohort, respectively. In contrast, GAD(67), SST and alpha1 subunit mRNA levels, as assessed by in situ hybridization, were not altered in the DLPFC of monkeys chronically exposed to antipsychotic medications. These findings suggest that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in inhibitory inputs from SST/NPY-containing and CCK-containing subpopulations of GABA neurons and in the signaling via certain GABA(A) receptors that mediate synaptic (phasic) or extrasynaptic (tonic) inhibition. In concert with previous findings, these data suggest that working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia is mediated by altered GABA neurotransmission in certain DLPFC microcircuits.},

Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens in healthy humans are used as models for psychotic states. Previous studies reported a significant reduction of MMN after ketamine (N-methyl-D-aspartate acid [NMDA] antagonist model) but not after psilocybin (5HT2A agonist model).The aim of the present study was to directly compare the two models of psychosis using an intraindividual crossover design.Fifteen healthy subjects participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with a low and a high dose of the 5HT2A agonist dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and the NMDA antagonist S-ketamine. During electroencephalographic recording, the subjects were performing the AX-version of a continuous performance test (AX-CPT). A source analysis of MMN was performed on the basis of a four-source model of MMN generation.Nine subjects completed both experimental days with the two doses of both drugs. Overall, we found blunted MMN and performance deficits in the AX-CPT after both drugs. However, the reduction in MMN activity was overall more pronounced after S-ketamine intake, and only S-ketamine had a significant impact on the frontal source of MMN.The NDMA antagonist model and the 5HT2A agonist model of psychosis display distinct neurocognitive profiles. These findings are in line with the view of the two classes of hallucinogens modeling different aspects of psychosis.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal GABAergic interneurons show diverse molecular and morphological properties. The functional significance of this diversity for information processing is poorly understood. Here we show that cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons in rat dentate gyrus release GABA in a highly asynchronous manner, in contrast to parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. With a gamma-frequency burst of ten action potentials, the ratio of asynchronous to synchronous release is 3:1 in CCK interneurons but is 1:5 in parvalbumin interneurons. N-type channels trigger synchronous and asynchronous release in CCK interneuron synapses, whereas P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels mediate release at PV interneuron synapses. Effects of Ca(2+) chelators suggest that both a long-lasting presynaptic Ca(2+) transient and a large distance between Ca(2+) source and sensor of exocytosis contribute to the higher ratio of asynchronous to synchronous release in CCK interneuron synapses. Asynchronous release occurs at physiological temperature and with behaviorally relevant stimulation patterns, thus generating long-lasting inhibition in the brain.},

Despite the fundamental importance of this process, neither the relationship between presynaptic intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) and rate of exocytosis, nor the maximal rate of secretion is known quantitatively. To provide this information, we have used flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ to elevate [Ca2+]i rapidly and uniformly in synaptic terminals, while measuring membrane capacitance as an index of exocytosis and monitoring [Ca2+]i with a Ca(2+)-indicator dye. When [Ca2+]i was abruptly increased to > 10 microM, capacitance rose at a rate that increased steeply with [Ca2+]i. The steepness suggested that at least four calcium ions must bind to activate synaptic vesicle fusion. Half-saturation was at 194 microM, and the maximal rate constant was 2,000-3,000 s-1. A given synaptic vesicle can exocytose with high probability within a few hundred microseconds, if [Ca2+]i rises above 100 microM. These properties provide for the extremely rapid signalling required for neuronal communication.},

  abstract    = {Retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids (eCBs) mediates a widely expressed form of long-term depression at excitatory and inhibitory synapses (eCB-LTD), involving a reduction in neurotransmitter release. In the hippocampus, eCB-LTD occurs at interneuron (IN)-pyramidal cell (PC) synapses (I-LTD), and its induction requires a presynaptic reduction of cAMP/PKA signaling resulting from minutes of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) activation. Although repetitive activity of glutamatergic synapses initiates the eCB mobilization required for I-LTD, it is unclear whether CB1R-containing GABAergic terminals are passive targets of eCBs or whether they actively contribute to induction. Here, we show that the minutes-long induction period for I-LTD may serve as a window to integrate associated spontaneous activity in the same IN receiving the retrograde eCB signal. Indeed, reducing spontaneous IN firing blocked I-LTD, which could be rescued with extra stimulation of inhibitory afferents. Moreover, cell pair recordings showed that a single IN expressed LTD onto a PC only if it was active during eCB signaling. Several methods of disrupting presynaptic Ca(2+) dynamics all blocked I-LTD, strongly suggesting that IN spikes regulate I-LTD by raising Ca(2+) at the nerve terminal. Finally, inhibiting the Ca(2+)-activated phosphatase, calcineurin, fully blocked I-LTD, but blocking another phosphatase did not. Our findings support a model where both CB1R signaling and IN activity shift the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity in the presynaptic terminal to induce I-LTD.},

A battery of physiological, subjective, and performance measures was repeated throughout day 1 to assess acute effects and on day 2 to measure any residual effects of marijuana. Blood samples were also repeatedly collected to examine the relationship between plasma levels and pharmacological effects of THC. Acutely, marijuana increased heart rate and subjective ratings of drug effects and slightly impaired performance on a circular lights task in all subjects. Performance was also impaired (decreased accuracy and increased response time) on serial addition/subtraction and digit recall tasks on day 1 in two subjects. On day 2, tachycardia and subjective effects of marijuana were not observed. Performance remained impaired on the arithmetic and recall tasks on day 2, although the decrements were not as large as those observed on day 1. In general, plasma THC levels covaried with the other measures. These preliminary results suggest that marijuana can adversely affect complex human performance up to 24 hours after smoking.},

The effect of cannabis use was much stronger in those with any predisposition for psychosis at baseline (23.8\% adjusted difference in risk, 95\% confidence interval 7.9 to 39.7, P = 0.003) than in those without (5.6\%, 0.4 to 10.8, P = 0.033). The risk difference in the "predisposition" group was significantly greater than the risk difference in the "no predisposition" group (test for interaction 18.2\%, 1.6 to 34.8, P = 0.032). There was a dose-response relation with increasing frequency of cannabis use. Predisposition for psychosis at baseline did not significantly predict cannabis use four years later (adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95\% confidence interval 0.88 to 2.31).Cannabis use moderately increases the risk of psychotic symptoms in young people but has a much stronger effect in those with evidence of predisposition for psychosis.},

To investigate the overall effect size and consistency of the association between cannabis and psychosis, a meta-analysis from prospective studies was carried out. The pooled odds ratio was 2.1 (95\% CI: 1.7-2.5) and could not be explained by confounding or reverse causality. Evidence suggests that cannabis is a component cause in the development and prognosis of psychosis, in which mechanisms of gene-environment interaction are most likely to explain this association.

  abstract    = {Observational studies have suggested that psychometric psychosis liability and a functional polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT Val(158)Met) gene moderate the psychosis-inducing effect of cannabis. To replicate and extend this finding, a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design was used in which patients with a psychotic disorder (n=30), relatives of patients with a psychotic disorder (n=12), and healthy controls (n=32) were exposed to Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC, the principal component of cannabis) or placebo, followed by cognitive assessment and assessment of current psychotic experiences. Previous expression of psychometric psychosis liability was also assessed. Models of current psychotic experiences and cognition were examined with multilevel random regression analyses to assess (i) main effects of genotype and condition, (ii) interactions between condition and genotype, and (iii) three-way interactions between condition, genotype, and psychometric psychosis liability. Carriers of the Val allele were most sensitive to Delta-9-THC-induced psychotic experiences, but this was conditional on prior evidence of psychometric psychosis liability. Delta-9-THC impacted negatively on cognitive measures. Carriers of the Val allele were also more sensitive to Delta-9-THC-induced memory and attention impairments compared to carriers of the Met allele. Experimental effects of Delta-9-THC on cognition and psychosis are moderated by COMT Val(158)Met genotype, but the effects may in part be conditional on the additional presence of pre-existing psychosis liability. The association between cannabis and psychosis may represent higher order gene-environment and gene-gene interactions.},

  abstract    = {A prominent view in the neuropsychological literature is that schizophrenia is particularly associated with executive dysfunction, yet in a meta-analytic review it was concluded that, relative to their general level of intellectual functioning, schizophrenics are not disproportionately impaired on a measure of this construct, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). However, verbal fluency tests may be more valid measures of executive functioning as they are more sensitive to the presence of focal frontal lobe injuries.A meta-analysis was conducted on 84 studies comparing the performance of schizophrenics and healthy controls on tests of phonemic and semantic fluency, as well as other cognitive measures presumed to impose only minimal demands on executive functioning.Neither phonemic or semantic fluency deficits qualified as differential deficits relative to general intelligence or psychomotor speed. Patients with schizophrenia were significantly more impaired on semantic relative to phonemic fluency.As for the WCST, deficits on tests of verbal fluency reflect a more generalised intellectual impairment and not particular difficulties with executive control processes. The larger deficit for semantic relative to phonemic fluency suggests that, in addition to general retrieval difficulties, schizophrenia is associated with compromises to the semantic store.},

THC increased the subjective time rate (STR); i.e., the rate at which subjective time passes relative to clock time, whereas atropine had no effect on STR. Thus, reduction in central acetylcholine activity is not a sufficient explanation of THC's effect on STR. Experiment 2 replicated the THC effect on STR when subjects were counting subjective seconds. This result indicates that THC affects the experience of time as it is passing, and not solely the memory for duration experience after a time period.},

  abstract    = {The cannabinoid receptor CB1 is found in abundance in brain neurons, whereas CB2 is essentially expressed outside the brain. In the neocortex, CB1 is observed predominantly on large cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons. However, physiological evidence suggests that functional CB1 are present on other neocortical neuronal types. We investigated the expression of CB1 and CB2 in identified neurons of rat neocortical slices using single-cell RT-PCR. We found that 63\% of somatostatin (SST)-expressing and 69\% of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons co-expressed CB1. As much as 49\% of pyramidal neurons expressed CB1. In contrast, CB2 was observed in a small proportion of neocortical neurons. We performed whole cell recordings of pyramidal neurons to corroborate our molecular findings. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) induced by a mixed muscarinic/nicotinic cholinergic agonist showed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and were decreased by the CB1 agonist WIN-55212-2 (WIN-2), suggesting that interneurons excited by cholinergic agonists (mainly SST and VIP neurons) possess CB1. IPSCs elicited by a nicotinic receptor agonist were also reduced in the presence of WIN-2, suggesting that neurons excited by nicotinic agonists (mainly VIP neurons) indeed possess CB1. WIN-2 largely decreased excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by intracortical electrical stimulation, pointing at the presence of CB1 on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons. All WIN-2 effects were strongly reduced by the CB1 antagonist AM 251. We conclude that CB1 is expressed in various neocortical neuronal populations, including glutamatergic neurons. Our combined molecular and physiological data suggest that CB1 widely mediates endocannabinoid effects on glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission to modulate cortical networks.},

Using 3D reconstructions of 298 neocortical cells of different types (including nest basket, small basket, large basket, bitufted, pyramidal, and Martinotti cells), we constructed a structural model of a cortical microcircuit, in which cells of different types were independently and randomly placed. We compared the positions of physical appositions resulting from the incidental overlap of axonal and dendritic arbors in the model (statistical structural connectivity) with the positions of putative functional synapses (functional synaptic connectivity) in 90 synaptic connections reconstructed from cortical slice preparations. Overall, we found that statistical connectivity predicted an average of 74 ± 2.7\% (mean ± SEM) synapse location distributions for nine types of cortical connections. This finding suggests that chemospecific attractive and repulsive mechanisms generally do not result in pairwise-specific connectivity. In some cases, however, the predicted distributions do not match precisely, indicating that chemospecific steering and aligning of the arbors may occur for some types of connections. This finding suggests that random alignment of axonal and dendritic arbors provides a sufficient foundation for specific functional connectivity to emerge in local neural microcircuits.},

Here we show how to make this transition for models implemented with NEURON, in such a way that the final result will run and produce numerically identical results on either serial or parallel hardware. This allows users to develop and debug models on readily available local resources, then run their code without modification on a parallel supercomputer.},

The goal of this study was to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to identify brain regions that exhibit abnormal resting-state connectivity in the alpha frequency range in patients with schizophrenia and investigate associations between functional connectivity and clinical symptoms in stable outpatient participants.Thirty patients with SZ and 15 healthy comparison participants were scanned in resting-state MEG (eyes closed). Functional connectivity MEG source data were reconstructed globally in the alpha range, quantified by the mean imaginary coherence between a voxel and the rest of the brain.In patients, decreased connectivity was observed in left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right superior temporal cortex, whereas increased connectivity was observed in left extrastriate cortex and the right inferior PFC. Functional connectivity of left inferior parietal cortex was negatively related to positive symptoms. Low left PFC connectivity was associated with negative symptoms. Functional connectivity of midline PFC was negatively correlated with depressed symptoms. Functional connectivity of right PFC was associated with other (cognitive) symptoms.This study demonstrates direct functional disconnection in SZ between specific cortical fields within low-frequency resting-state oscillations. Impaired alpha coupling in frontal, parietal, and temporal regions is associated with clinical symptoms in these stable outpatients. Our findings indicate that this level of functional disconnection between cortical regions is an important treatment target in SZ.},

  abstract    = {A major goal of translational neuroscience is to identify neural circuit abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders that can be studied in animal models to facilitate the development of new treatments. Oscillations in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) of the electroencephalogram have received considerable interest as the basic mechanisms underlying these oscillations are understood, and gamma abnormalities have been found in schizophrenia (SZ). Animal models of SZ based on hypofunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) demonstrate increased spontaneous broadband gamma power, but this phenomenon has not been identified clearly in patients with SZ.To examine spontaneous gamma power and its relationship to evoked gamma oscillations in the auditory cortex of patients with SZ.We performed a cross-sectional study including 24 patients with chronic SZ and 24 matched healthy control participants at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2012. Electroencephalograms were obtained during auditory steady-state stimulation at multiple frequencies (20, 30, and 40 Hz) and during a resting state in 18 participants in each group.Electroencephalographic activity in the auditory cortex was estimated using dipole source localization. Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) measures included the phase-locking factor and evoked power. Spontaneous gamma power was measured as induced (non-phase-locked) gamma power in the ASSR data and as total gamma power in the resting-state data.The ASSR phase-locking factor was reduced significantly in patients with SZ compared with controls for the 40-Hz stimulation (mean [SD], 0.075 [0.028] vs 0.113 [0.065]; F1,46 = 6.79 [P = .012]) but not the 20- or the 30-Hz stimulation (0.042 [0.038] vs 0.043 [0.034]; F1,46 = 0.006 [P = .938] and 0.084 [0.040] vs 0.098 [0.050]; F1,46 = 1.605 [P = .212], respectively), repeating previous findings. The mean [SD] broadband-induced (30-100 Hz) gamma power was increased in patients with SZ compared with controls during steady-state stimulation (6.579 [3.783] vs 3.984 [1.843]; F1,46 = 9.128 [P = .004]; d = 0.87) but not during rest (0.006 [0.003] vs 0.005 [0.002]; F1,34 = 1.067 [P = .309]; d = 0.35). Induced gamma power in the left hemisphere of the patients with SZ during the 40-Hz stimulation was positively correlated with auditory hallucination symptoms (tangential, ρ = 0.587 [P = .031]; radial, ρ = 0.593 [P = .024]) and negatively correlated with the ASSR phase-locking factor (ρ < 0.334 [P > .175, uncorrected]).Spontaneous gamma activity is increased during auditory steady-state stimulation in SZ, reflecting a disruption in the normal balance of excitation and inhibition. This phenomenon interacts with evoked oscillations, possibly contributing to the gamma ASSR deficit found in SZ. The similarity of increased spontaneous gamma power in SZ to the findings of increased spontaneous gamma power in animal models of NMDAR hypofunction suggests that spontaneous gamma power could serve as a biomarker for the integrity of NMDARs on parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in humans and in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract  = {Genetically encoded sensors of glutamate concentration are based on {FRET} between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins bracketing a bacterial glutamate-binding protein. Such sensors have yet to find quantitative applications in neurons, because of poor response amplitude in physiological buffers or when expressed on the neuronal cell surface. We have improved our glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter {(GluSnFR)} by systematic optimization of linker sequences and glutamate affinities. Using {SuperGluSnFR}, which exhibits a 6.2-fold increase in response magnitude over the original {GluSnFR}, we demonstrate quantitative optical measurements of the time course of synaptic glutamate release, spillover, and reuptake in cultured hippocampal neurons with centisecond temporal and spine-sized spatial resolution. During burst firing, functionally significant spillover persists for hundreds of milliseconds. These glutamate levels appear sufficient to prime {NMDA} receptors, potentially affecting dendritic spike initiation and computation. Stimulation frequency-dependent modulation of spillover suggests a mechanism for nonsynaptic neuronal communication.},

Self-report of cannabis-use last month by TLFB. Pearson's r, sensitivity and specificity calculated as measures of correlation or agreement.Correlations were strong; r = 0.75 for number of days and r = 0.83 for number of standard joints in the preceding month when excluding outliers. Including outliers, coefficients were moderate to strong (r = 0.49). There were differences in subgroups, mainly inconsistent, depending on inclusion or exclusion of outliers. Sensitivity and specificity for TLFB detecting the presence or absence of cannabis use were 95.7\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) 88.0-99.1\%) and 72.2\% (95\% CI 46.5-90.3\%), respectively. Using 19 days as cut-off on TLFB, they were 94.3\% (95\% CI 86.0-98.4\%) and 94.4\% (95\% CI 72.2-99.9\%), respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96.Timeline follow-back (TLFB)-assisted self-report of cannabis use correlates highly with plasma-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in patients with comorbid cannabis use disorder and psychosis. Sensitivity and specificity of timeline follow-back appear to be optimized with 19 days as the cut-off point. As such, timeline follow-back may be superior to analysis of blood when going beyond 19 days of recall.},

  abstract    = {Memory deficits produced by marijuana arise partly via interaction of the psychoactive component, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), with cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus. Although cannabinoids acutely reduce glutamate release and block hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a potential substrate for learning and memory, the consequences of prolonged exposure to Delta(9)-THC for hippocampal function are poorly understood. Rats were injected with Delta(9)-THC (10 mg/kg, i.p., q.d.) for 1, 3, or 7 d, and electrophysiological recordings were performed in hippocampal slices 1d after the final injection. At this time, Delta(9)-THC was undetectable in hippocampus using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Hippocampal LTP generated using high-frequency (HFS) or theta burst stimulation was not observed in brain slices from the 7-d Delta(9)-THC-treated animals. Delta(9)-THC also blocked HFS-LTP after 3 d, but not 1 d of treatment. The complete blockade of LTP persisted for 3 d after the last Delta(9)-THC injection, and full reversal of the LTP deficit was not observed up to 14 d following Delta(9)-THC withdrawal. The cannabinoid antagonist AM251 (2 mg/kg), administered before each Delta(9)-THC injection prevented the blockade of LTP, and 7-d treatment with AM251 alone significantly increased the level of LTP. Chronic Delta(9)-THC also produced tolerance to the inhibition of synaptic GABA, but not glutamate release by the agonist WIN55,212-2. These data define consequences of repeated Delta(9)-THC exposure for synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus that may help explain memory impairments in humans following chronic marijuana use.},

  abstract    = {The possible localization of cannabinoid (CB) receptors to glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic terminals impinging upon GABAergic interneurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus was examined using the electrophysiological measurement of neurotransmitter release in brain slices. Whereas activation of cannabinoid receptors via the application of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 significantly and dose-dependently reduced evoked IPSCs recorded from interneurons possessing somata located in the stratum radiatum (S.R.) and stratum oriens (S.O.) lamellae, evoked glutamatergic EPSCs were unaffected in both neuronal populations. However, in agreement with previous reports, WIN55,212-2 significantly reduced EPSCs recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons. Additional experiments confirmed that the effects of WIN55,212-2 on IPSCs were presynaptic and that they could be blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. The involvement of endogenous cannabinoids in the presynaptic inhibition of GABA release was also examined in the interneurons and pyramidal cells using a depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) paradigm. DSI was observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons under control conditions, and its incidence was greatly increased by the cholinergic agonist carbachol. However, DSI was not observed in the S.R. or S.O. interneuron populations, in either the presence or absence of carbachol. Whereas DSI was not present in these interneurons, the inhibitory inputs to these cells were modulated by the synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2. These data support the hypothesis that cannabinoid receptors are located on inhibitory, but not excitatory, axon terminals impinging upon hippocampal interneurons, and that CA1 pyramidal neurons, and not interneurons, are capable of generating endogenous cannabinoids during prolonged states of depolarization.},

  abstract    = {Various malfunctions involving working memory, semantics, prediction error, and dopamine neuromodulation have been hypothesized to cause disorganized speech and delusions in schizophrenia. Computational models may provide insights into why some mechanisms are unlikely, suggest alternative mechanisms, and tie together explanations of seemingly disparate symptoms and experimental findings.Eight corresponding illness mechanisms were simulated in DISCERN, an artificial neural network model of narrative understanding and recall. For this study, DISCERN learned sets of autobiographical and impersonal crime stories with associated emotion coding. In addition, 20 healthy control subjects and 37 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder matched for age, gender, and parental education were studied using a delayed story recall task. A goodness-of-fit analysis was performed to determine the mechanism best reproducing narrative breakdown profiles generated by healthy control subjects and patients with schizophrenia. Evidence of delusion-like narratives was sought in simulations best matching the narrative breakdown profile of patients.All mechanisms were equivalent in matching the narrative breakdown profile of healthy control subjects. However, exaggerated prediction-error signaling during consolidation of episodic memories, termed hyperlearning, was statistically superior to other mechanisms in matching the narrative breakdown profile of patients. These simulations also systematically confused autobiographical agents with impersonal crime story agents to model fixed, self-referential delusions.Findings suggest that exaggerated prediction-error signaling in schizophrenia intermingles and corrupts narrative memories when incorporated into long-term storage, thereby disrupting narrative language and producing fixed delusional narratives. If further validated by clinical studies, these computational patients could provide a platform for developing and testing novel treatments.},

  abstract    = {Recent advances in immunohistochemical techniques have, contrary to earlier reports, positively identified CB1 receptors on glutamatergic terminals in the hippocampus. Further work has implicated these receptors in modulation of susceptibility to kainic acid induced seizures. Based on these results, the current study was designed to test the hypothesis that both exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids can selectively modulate glutamatergic afferents to CA3 pyramidal cells, and that such modulation is mediated by cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. Towards that end we employed either conventional or two-photon guided minimal stimulation techniques to isolate mossy fiber and/or associational/commissural (A/C) inputs to CA3 pyramidal cells. We report that bath application of WIN55,212-2 selectively inhibits minimally evoked A/C inputs to CA3 pyramidal cells, without significantly altering simultaneously recorded mossy fiber inputs. Further, we find that WIN55,212-2 mediated inhibition of A/C inputs is completely blocked by the CB1 selective antagonist AM-251 and absent in CB1(-/-) animals, suggesting a dependence on CB1 receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that depolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells leads to calcium dependent release of endogenous cannabinoids that transiently inhibit A/C mediated responses, and that this effect is also sensitive to both AM-251 and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine. To our knowledge this represents the first demonstration of depolarization induced suppression of excitation in area CA3 of the hippocampus. Collectively, these results provide new information relevant to developing a thorough understanding of how ECs modulate excitatory transmission in an area that is both essential for the acquisition of new memories and intimately involved in epileptogenesis.},

  abstract    = {The effects of cannabinoid agonists on noxious heat-evoked firing of 62 spinal wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons were examined in urethan-anesthetized rats (1 cell/animal). Noxious thermal stimulation was applied with a Peltier device to the receptive fields in the ipsilateral hindpaw of isolated WDR neurons. To assess the site of action, cannabinoids were administered systemically in intact and spinally transected rats and intraventricularly. Both the aminoalkylindole cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 (125 microg/kg iv) and the bicyclic cannabinoid CP55,940 (125 microg/kg iv) suppressed noxious heat-evoked activity. Responses evoked by mild pressure in nonnociceptive neurons were not altered by CP55,940 (125 microg/kg iv), consistent with previous observations with another cannabinoid agonist, WIN55,212-2. The cannabinoid induced-suppression of noxious heat-evoked activity was blocked by pretreatment with SR141716A (1 mg/kg iv), a competitive antagonist for central cannabinoid CB1 receptors. By contrast, intravenous administration of either vehicle or the receptor-inactive enantiomer WIN55,212-3 (125 microg/kg) failed to alter noxious heat-evoked activity. The suppression of noxious heat-evoked activity induced by WIN55,212-2 in the lumbar dorsal horn of intact animals was markedly attenuated in spinal rats. Moreover, intraventricular administration of WIN55,212-2 suppressed noxious heat-evoked activity in spinal WDR neurons. By contrast, both vehicle and enantiomer were inactive. These findings suggest that cannabinoids selectively modulate the activity of nociceptive neurons in the spinal dorsal horn by actions at CB1 receptors. This modulation represents a suppression of pain neurotransmission because the inhibitory effects are selective for pain-sensitive neurons and are observed with different modalities of noxious stimulation. The data also provide converging lines of evidence for a role for descending antinociceptive mechanisms in cannabinoid modulation of spinal nociceptive processing.},

  abstract    = {CB(1) cannabinoid receptor (CB(1)R) activation by exogenous ligands can impair memory processes, which critically depend on synchronous neuronal activities that are temporarily structured by oscillations. In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms underlying the cannabinoid-induced decrease in gamma oscillations. We first verified that cannabinoids (CP55,940 and WIN55,212-2) readily suppressed carbachol-induced gamma oscillations in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices via activation of CB(1)Rs. The cannabinoid-induced decrease in the peak power of oscillations was accompanied by reduced and less precise firing activity in CA3 pyramidal cells and fast spiking basket cells. By examining the cannabinoid sensitivity of synaptic inputs we found that the amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents was significantly suppressed upon CB(1)R activation in both CA3 pyramidal cells and fast spiking basket cells. In contrast, evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents in CA3 pyramidal cells were unaltered. Furthermore, we observed that a CB(1)R agonist-induced decrease in the oscillation power at the beginning of the drug application was accompanied primarily by the reduced discharge of fast spiking basket cells, while pyramidal cell firing was unaltered. This result implies that the dampening of cholinergically induced gamma oscillations in the hippocampus by cannabinoids can be explained by a reduced excitatory input predominantly onto fast spiking basket cells, which leads to a reduction in neuronal firing frequency and precision, and thus to smaller field potentials. In addition, we uncovered that the spontaneously occurring sharp wave-ripple activities in hippocampal slices could also be suppressed by CB(1)R activation suggesting that cannabinoids profoundly reduce the intrinsically generated oscillatory activities at distinct frequencies in CA3 networks by reducing synaptic neurotransmission.},

  abstract    = {Several electrical neural oscillatory abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia, although the underlying mechanisms of these oscillatory problems are unclear. Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies.},

Neuronal mechanisms supporting the maintenance of feature-specific information have remained unidentified. Synchronized oscillations in the gamma band (30-120 Hz) characterize VWM retention and predict task performance, but whether these oscillations are specific to memorized features and VWM contents or underlie general executive VWM functions is not known. In the present study, we investigated whether gamma oscillations reflect the maintenance of feature-specific information in VWM. Concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography was recorded while subjects memorized different object features or feature conjunctions in identical VWM experiments. Using a data-driven source analysis approach, we show that the strength, load-dependence, and source topographies of gamma oscillations in the visual cortex differentiate these memorized features. Load-dependence of gamma oscillations in feature-specific visual and prefrontal areas also predicts VWM accuracy. Furthermore, corroborating the hypothesis that gamma oscillations support the perceptual binding of feature-specific neuronal assemblies, we also show that VWM for color-location conjunctions is associated with stronger gamma oscillations than that for these features separately. Gamma oscillations hence support the maintenance of feature-specific information and reflect VWM contents. The results also suggest that gamma oscillations contribute to feature binding in the formation of memory representations.},

  abstract    = {Recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. It has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. An elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([Ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. However, the precise relationship between [Ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. To probe the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (AP)-like stimuli, we monitored [Ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of Held synapse. We found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [Ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. The slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microM x s). Blocking Ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state EPSCs during 100 Hz AP-like trains were maintained through this Ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. Using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [Ca2+]i. We could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 AP-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of EPSC depression.},

  abstract    = {Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is the principal mediator of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling in the brain. In this study, we addressed the topographic distribution and amino acid neurotransmitter phenotype of endocannabinoid-sensitive hypothalamic neurons in mice. The in situ hybridization detection of CB1 mRNA revealed high levels of expression in the medial septum (MS) and the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), moderate levels in the preoptic area and the hypothalamic lateroanterior (LA), paraventricular (Pa), ventromedial (VMH), lateral mammillary (LM), and ventral premammillary (PMV) nuclei, and low levels in many other hypothalamic regions including the suprachiasmatic (SCh) and arcuate (Arc) nuclei. This regional distribution pattern was compared with location of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic cell groups, as identified by the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and type 2 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2) mRNAs, respectively. The MS, DBB, and preoptic area showed overlaps between GABAergic and CB1-expressing neurons, whereas hypothalamic sites with moderate CB1 signals, including the LA, Pa, VMH, LM, and PMV, were dominated by glutamatergic neurons. Low CB1 mRNA levels were also present in other glutamatergic and GABAergic regions. Dual-label in situ hybridization experiments confirmed the cellular co-expression of CB1 with both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers. In this report we provide a detailed anatomical map of hypothalamic glutamatergic and GABAergic systems whose neurotransmitter release is controlled by retrograde endocannabinoid signaling from hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic target neurons. This neuroanatomical information contributes to an understanding of the role that the endocannabinoid system plays in the regulation of endocrine and metabolic functions.},

However, little is known about what happens to the receptor as tolerance is developing. In this study, we have found that CB1 receptors are rapidly internalized following agonist binding and receptor activation. Efficacious cannabinoid agonists (WIN 55,212-2, CP 55,940, and HU 210) caused rapid internalization. Methanandamide (an analogue of an endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide) was less effective, causing internalization only at high concentration, whereas delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol caused little internalization, even at 3 microM. CB1 internalized via clathrin-coated pits as sequestration was inhibited by hypertonic sucrose. Internalization did not require activated G protein alpha(i), alpha(o), or alpha(s) subunits. A region of the extreme carboxy terminus of the receptor was necessary for internalization, as a mutant CB1 receptor lacking the last 14 residues did not internalize, whereas a mutant lacking the last 10 residues did. Steps involved in the recycling of sequestered receptor were also investigated. Recovery of CB1 to the cell surface after short (20 min) but not long (90 min) agonist treatment was independent of new protein synthesis. Recycling also required endosomal acidification and dephosphorylation. These results show that CB1 receptor trafficking is dynamically regulated by cannabimimetic drugs.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia is a complex disease with multiple factors contributing to its pathogenesis. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors may also increase susceptibility. In other words, schizophrenia is a highly heritable disease. Some candidate genes have been deduced on the basis of their known function with others found on the basis of chromosomal location. Individuals with multiple candidate genes may have increased risk. However it is not clear what kind of gene combinations may produce the disease phenotype. Their collective effect remains to be studied.Most pathways except metabolic pathways are rich in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Thus, the PPI network contains pathway information, even though the upstream-downstream relation of PPI is yet to be explored. Here we have constructed a PPI sub-network by extracting the nearest neighbour of the 36 reported candidate genes described in the literature. Although these candidate genes were discovered by different approaches, most of the proteins formed a cluster. Two major protein interaction modules were identified on the basis of the pairwise distance among the proteins in this sub-network. The large and small clusters might play roles in synaptic transmission and signal transduction, respectively, based on gene ontology annotation. The protein interactions in the synaptic transmission cluster were used to explain the interaction between the NRG1 and CACNG2 genes, which was found by both linkage and association studies. This working hypothesis is supported by the co-expression analysis based on public microarray gene expression.On the basis of the protein interaction network, it appears that the NRG1-triggered NMDAR protein internalization and the CACNG2 mediated AMPA receptor recruiting may act together in the glutamatergic signalling process. Since both the NMDA and AMPA receptors are calcium channels, this process may regulate the influx of Ca2+. Reducing the cation influx might be one of the disease mechanisms for schizophrenia. This PPI network analysis approach combined with the support from co-expression analysis may provide an efficient way to propose pathogenetic mechanisms for various highly heritable diseases.},

  abstract    = {Computational pharmacology can uniquely address some issues in the process of drug development by providing a macroscopic view and a deeper understanding of drug action. Specifically, network-assisted approach is promising for the inference of drug repurposing. However, the drug-target associations coming from different sources and various assays have much noise, leading to an inflation of the inference errors. To reduce the inference errors, it is necessary and critical to create a comprehensive and weighted data set of drug-target associations.In this study, we created a weighted and integrated drug-target interactome (WinDTome) to provide a comprehensive resource of drug-target associations for computational pharmacology. We first collected drug-target interactions from six commonly used drug-target centered data sources including DrugBank, KEGG, TTD, MATADOR, PDSP Ki Database, and BindingDB. Then, we employed the record linkage method to normalize drugs and targets to the unique identifiers by utilizing the public data sources including PubChem, Entrez Gene, and UniProt. To assess the reliability of the drug-target associations, we assigned two scores (Score_S and Score_R) to each drug-target association based on their data sources and publication references. Consequently, the WinDTome contains 546,196 drug-target associations among 303,018 compounds and 4,113 genes. To assess the application of the WinDTome, we designed a network-based approach for drug repurposing using mental disorder schizophrenia (SCZ) as a case. Starting from 41 known SCZ drugs and their targets, we inferred a total of 264 potential SCZ drugs through the associations of drug-target with Score_S higher than two in WinDTome and human protein-protein interactions. Among the 264 SCZ-related drugs, 39 drugs have been investigated in clinical trials for SCZ treatment and 74 drugs for the treatment of other mental disorders, respectively. Compared with the results using other Score_S cutoff values, single data source, or the data from STITCH, the inference of 264 SCZ-related drugs had the highest performance.The WinDTome generated in this study contains comprehensive drug-target associations with confidence scores. Its application to the SCZ drug repurposing demonstrated that the WinDTome is promising to serve as a useful resource for drug repurposing.},

  abstract    = {Gamma-frequency oscillatory activity plays an important role in information integration across brain areas. Disruption in gamma oscillations is implicated in cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders, and 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3Rs) are suggested as therapeutic targets for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Using a 5-HT3aR-EGFP transgenic mouse line and inducing gamma oscillations by carbachol in hippocampal slices, we show that activation of 5-HT3aRs, which are exclusively expressed in cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing interneurons, selectively suppressed and desynchronized firings in these interneurons by enhancing spike-frequency accommodation in a small conductance potassium (SK)-channel-dependent manner. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons therefore received diminished inhibitory input leading to increased but desynchronized firings of PV cells. As a consequence, the firing of pyramidal neurons was desynchronized and gamma oscillations were impaired. These effects were independent of 5-HT3aR-mediated CCK release. Our results therefore revealed an important role of 5-HT3aRs in gamma oscillations and identified a novel crosstalk among different types of interneurons for regulation of network oscillations. The functional link between 5-HT3aR and gamma oscillations may have implications for understanding the cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract    = {Pharmacological blockade of NMDA receptors is used to model certain aspects of schizophrenia. It had been shown previously that ketamine dose dependently enhances high-frequency oscillations in the rodent nucleus accumbens, a structure implicated in schizophrenia. Here, the authors examined the effect of intra-accumbal and systemic administration of MK801 on delta, gamma and high-frequency oscillatory activity recorded in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats. In this study, rats were implanted with electrodes in the nucleus accumbens for chronic local field potential recording. Rats received either bilateral injections of MK801 (1 and 4 microg) or intraperitoneal injections of the drug (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg). Saline was used as control in each instance. Both local and systemic injections significantly enhanced the power and frequency of high-frequency oscillations and caused an increase in the occurrence, duration and amplitude of high-frequency oscillatory bursts. In contrast, no effect or a decrease in the power of delta and gamma bands was observed following local or systemic administration of MK801, respectively. These findings suggest that the dominant change in oscillatory activity after administration of NMDA receptor antagonists affect high frequencies. Moreover, direct NMDA blockade in the accumbal circuitry is sufficient to generate increases in high-frequency oscillations. The presence of abnormal oscillatory activity in the accumbens may be associated with the psychomimetic effects of NMDA receptor antagonists.},

Here, we explored the gene expression of hexokinase 1 (Hk1) and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) after the administration of a subanesthetic or a subconvulsant dose of ketamine in rats, considered to provide an animal model of psychosis. Indeed, Hk1 and GLUT3 are crucially involved in the glucose utilization in brain tissues and have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis. Quantitative brain imaging of transcripts was used to evaluate Hk1 and GLUT3 mRNA in rat brain regions related to ketamine-induced behavioral abnormalities. Hk1 transcript was significantly increased by 50 mg/kg ketamine in cortical and subcortical areas, whereas 12 mg/kg ketamine affected Hk1 expression in the auditory cortex only. GLUT3 expression was increased by 12 mg/kg ketamine in the frontal cortex and decreased by 50 mg/kg ketamine in subcortical areas. The results show that Hk1 and GLUT3 are extensively and differentially affected by ketamine dose, supporting the view that glucose metabolism and psychosis may be causally related and suggesting that these molecules may play a role in the pathophysiology of ketamine-induced behavioral abnormalities.},

  abstract    = {Electrical coupling between some subclasses of interneurons is thought to promote coordinated firing that generates rhythmic synchronous activity in cortical regions. Synaptic activity of cholecystokinin (CCK) interneurons which co-express cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors are powerful modulators of network activity via the actions of endocannabinoids. We investigated the modulatory actions of endocannabinoids between chemically and electrically connected synapses of CCK cells using paired whole-cell recordings combined with biocytin and double immunofluorescence labeling in acute slices of rat hippocampus at P18-20 days. CA1 stratum radiatum CCK Schaffer collateral-associated cells were coupled electrically with each other as well as CCK basket cells and CCK cells with axonal projections expanding to dentate gyrus. Approximately 50\% of electrically coupled cells received facilitating, asynchronously released inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSPs) that curtailed the steady-state coupling coefficient by 57\%. Tonic CB1 receptor activity which reduces inhibition enhanced electrical coupling between cells that were connected via chemical and electrical synapses. Blocking CB1 receptors with antagonist, AM-251 (5 μM) resulted in the synchronized release of larger IPSPs and this enhanced inhibition further reduced the steady-state coupling coefficient by 85\%. Depolarization induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), maintained the asynchronicity of IPSP latency, but reduced IPSP amplitudes by 95\% and enhanced the steady-state coupling coefficient by 104\% and IPSP duration by 200\%. However, DSI did not did not enhance electrical coupling at purely electrical synapses. These data suggest that different morphological subclasses of CCK interneurons are interconnected via gap junctions. The synergy between the chemical and electrical coupling between CCK cells probably plays a role in activity-dependent endocannabinoid modulation of rhythmic synchronization.},

In the four sessions under blinded conditions subjects smoked marijuana cigarettes containing placebo (no active cannabinoids), or cigarettes containing THC with low or high levels of cannabichromene (CBC; 0.1\% versus 0.5\%) and low or high levels of cannabidiol (CBD; 0.2\% versus 1.0\%). Dependent measures included subjective reports, measures of cognitive task performance and neurophysiological measures [electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP)]. Compared to placebo, active THC cigarettes produced expected effects on mood, behavior and brain activity. A decrease in performance, reduction in EEG power and attenuation of ERP components reflecting attentional processes were observed during tests of working memory and episodic memory. Most of these effects were not dose-dependent. Varying the concentrations of CBC and CBD did not change subjects' responses on any of the outcome measures. These findings are consistent with previous studies indicating that THC and its metabolites are the primary active constituents of marijuana. They also suggest that neurophysiological EEG and ERP measures are useful biomarkers of the effects of THC.},

We also present examples of their use to investigate the role of spike timing precision, correlations across neurons, and field potential fluctuations in the encoding of sensory information. These information toolboxes, available both in MATLAB and Python programming environments, hold the potential to enlarge the domain of application of information theory to neuroscience and to lead to new discoveries about how neurons encode and transmit information.},

  abstract    = {Information theory, the mathematical theory of communication in the presence of noise, is playing an increasingly important role in modern quantitative neuroscience. It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables. We also discuss how our use of Python is facilitating integration with collaborative databases and centralised computational resources.},

  abstract    = {Cognitive deficits are among the most reliable predictors of functional impairment in schizophrenia and a particular concern for older individuals with schizophrenia. Previous reviews have focused on the nature and course of cognitive impairments in younger cohorts, but a quantitative meta-analysis in older patients is pending.A previously used search strategy identified studies assessing performance on tests of global cognition and specific neuropsychological domains in older patients with schizophrenia and age-matched comparison groups. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were included. Potential methodological, demographic, and clinical moderators were analyzed.Twenty-nine cross-sectional (2110 patients, 1738 comparison subjects) and 14 longitudinal (954 patients) studies met inclusion criteria. Patients were approximately 65 years old, with 11 years of education, 53\% male and 79\% Caucasian. Longitudinal analysis (range 1-6 years) revealed homogeneity with small effect sizes (d = -0.097) being observed. Cross-sectional analyses revealed large and heterogeneous deficits in global cognition (d = -1.19) and on specific neuropsychological tests (d = -0.7 to -1.14). Moderator analysis revealed a significant role for demographic (age, sex, education, race) and clinical factors (diagnosis, inpatient status, age of onset, duration of illness, positive and negative symptomology). Medication status (medicated vs nonmedicated) and chlorpromazine equivalents were inconsequential, albeit underrepresented.Large and generalized cognitive deficits in older individuals with schizophrenia represent a robust finding paralleling impairments across the life span, but these deficits do not decline over a 1-6 year period. The importance of considering demographic and clinical moderators in cross-sectional analyses is highlighted.},

  abstract    = {Despite extensive study over the past decades, available treatments for schizophrenia are only modestly effective and cause serious metabolic and neurological side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of schizophrenia. A highly promising new pharmacological target in the context of schizophrenia is the endocannabinoid system. Modulation of this system by the main psychoactive component in cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), induces acute psychotic effects and cognitive impairment. However, the non-psychotropic, plant-derived cannabinoid agent cannabidiol (CBD) may have antipsychotic properties, and thus may be a promising new agent in the treatment of schizophrenia. Here we review studies that investigated the antipsychotic properties of CBD in human subjects. Results show the ability of CBD to counteract psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment associated with cannabis use as well as with acute THC administration. In addition, CBD may lower the risk for developing psychosis that is related to cannabis use. These effects are possibly mediated by opposite effects of CBD and THC on brain activity patterns in key regions implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, such as the striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The first small-scale clinical studies with CBD treatment of patients with psychotic symptoms further confirm the potential of CBD as an effective, safe and well-tolerated antipsychotic compound, although large randomised clinical trials will be needed before this novel therapy can be introduced into clinical practice.},

  abstract    = {The distribution of intrahippocampal projections arising from the CA3 region of the rat hippocampus was investigated using in vitro and in vivo methods. In the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation, single CA3 pyramidal cells were intracellularly labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and the three-dimensional organization of the axonal plexus was analyzed by using a computer-aided digitizing system. As many as eight primary collaterals originated from the principal axon of CA3 pyramidal cells and these commonly bifurcated further and innervated stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of CA3 and CA1. Within the 400 microns slice, the summed length of all visible collaterals per neuron ranged from 2.6 mm to approximately 12.5 mm. While the CA3 principal axon tended to be relatively smooth, the axonal collaterals bore numerous varicosities that electron microscopy confirmed to be presynaptic boutons. These varicosities occurred, on average, once every 7 microns of collateral length. The distribution of axonal collaterals differed depending on the location of the parent pyramidal cell. Only rarely could CA3 collaterals be followed in the slice to their terminations within CA1. To study the topographic organization of CA3 projections both to other levels of CA3 and to CA1, the anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) was injected into various transverse and septotemporal levels of CA3. Immunohistochemical visualization of the lectin was conducted in dissected and "extended" hippocampi to facilitate analysis of the topographic distribution of projections along the long or septotemporal axis. Projections from all portions of CA3 reached widespread regions of CA3, CA2, and CA1, but only a few fibers entered the subicular complex and there were no projections to the entorhinal cortex. There were also some CA3 and CA2 projections to the hilus of the dentate gyrus, but these did not enter the granule cell or molecular layers. The CA3 projections to CA1 were organized according to several distinctive and consistent gradients that can generally be summarized as follows. 1. CA3 cells located close to the dentate gyrus (proximal CA3), while projecting both septally and temporally, tended to project more heavily to levels of CA1 located septal to the injection site. CA3 cells located closer to CA1, in contrast, projected more heavily to levels of CA1 located temporally to the injection site. 2. At, or close to, the septotemporal level of the injection, cells located proximally in CA3 gave rise to collaterals that tended to terminate more superficially in stratum radiatum than did those arising from mid and distal levels of CA3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales.},

  abstract    = {The theta oscillation is a neuroscience enigma. When a rat runs through an environment, large-amplitude theta oscillations (4-10 Hz) reliably appear in the hippocampus's electrical activity. The consistency of this pattern led to theta playing a central role in theories on the neural basis of mammalian spatial navigation and memory. However, in fact, hippocampal oscillations at 4-10 Hz are rare in humans and in some other species. This presents a challenge for theories proposing theta as an essential component of the mammalian brain, including models of place and grid cells. Here, I examine this issue by reviewing recent research on human hippocampal oscillations using direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients. This work indicates that the human hippocampus does indeed exhibit rhythms that are functionally similar to theta oscillations found in rodents, but that these signals have a slower frequency of approximately 1-4 Hz. I argue that oscillatory models of navigation and memory derived from rodent data are relevant for humans, but that they should be modified to account for the slower frequency of the human theta rhythm.},

The eCB system also has an important role in reward mechanisms, and nicotine addiction has been associated with aberrant reward processing. Motivated by this evidence, we tested the hypothesis that eCB modulation of reward processing is altered in subjects with a nicotine addiction (NAD). For this purpose, we compared reward-related activity in NAD with healthy controls (HC) in a pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study using Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration to challenge the eCB system. Eleven HC and 10 NAD participated in a 3-T functional MRI (fMRI) study with a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design, using a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) paradigm with three reward levels. Reward activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caudate putamen during anticipation and feedback of reward was compared after THC and placebo. fMRI results indicated a significant reduction of reward anticipation activity in the NAcc in NAD after THC administration, which was not present in HC. This is indicated by a significant group by drug by reward interaction. Our data show that THC significantly reduces the NAcc response to monetary reward anticipation in NAD. These results suggest that nicotine addiction is associated with altered eCB modulation of reward processing in the NAcc. This study adds important human data to existing evidence implicating the eCB system in nicotine addiction.},

The National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria position these deficits as intermediaries between molecular and cellular mechanisms and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations. The prepulse inhibition of startle responses by a weaker preceding tone, the inhibitory gating of response to paired sensory stimuli characterized using the auditory P50 evoked response, and the detection of slight deviations in patterns of sensory stimulation eliciting the cortical mismatch negativity potential demonstrate deficits in early sensory processing mechanisms, whose molecular and neurobiological bases are increasingly well understood. Deficits in sensory processing underlie more complex cognitive dysfunction and are in turn affected by higher-level cognitive difficulties. These deficits are now being used to identify genes involved in familial transmission of schizophrenia and to monitor potentially therapeutic drug effects for both treatment and prevention. This research also provides a clinical reminder that patients' sensory perception of the surrounding world, even during treatment sessions, may differ considerably from others' perceptions. A person's ability to understand and interact effectively with the surrounding world ultimately depends on an underlying sensory experience of it.},

  abstract    = {Both theoretical and experimental animal work supports the hypothesis that transient oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies at gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz) is closely associated with sensory processing. Recent data from recordings in animals and humans have suggested that gamma-frequency activity also has an important role in attention and both working and long-term memory. The involvement of gamma-band synchronization in various cognitive paradigms in humans is currently being investigated using intracranial and high-density electro- and magnetoencephalography recordings. Here, we discuss recent findings demonstrating human gamma-frequency activity associated with attention and memory in both sensory and non-sensory areas. Because oscillatory gamma-frequency activity has an important role in neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity, it could provide a key for understanding neuronal processing in both local and distributed cortical networks engaged in complex cognitive functions. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast, based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium (http://inmednet.com).},

  abstract    = {Deciphering the interneuronal circuitry is central to understanding brain functions, yet it remains a challenging task in neurobiology. Using simultaneous quadruple-octuple in vitro and dual in vivo whole-cell recordings, we found two previously unknown interneuronal circuits that link cortical layer 1-3 (L1-3) interneurons and L5 pyramidal neurons in the rat neocortex. L1 single-bouquet cells (SBCs) preferentially formed unidirectional inhibitory connections on L2/3 interneurons that inhibited the entire dendritic-somato-axonal axis of ∼1\% of L5 pyramidal neurons located in the same column. In contrast, L1 elongated neurogliaform cells (ENGCs) frequently formed mutual inhibitory and electric connections with L2/3 interneurons, and these L1-3 interneurons inhibited the distal apical dendrite of >60\% of L5 pyramidal neurons across multiple columns. Functionally, SBC→L2/3 interneuron→L5 pyramidal neuronal circuits disinhibited and ENGC↔L2/3 interneuron→L5 pyramidal neuronal circuits inhibited the initiation of dendritic complex spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons. As dendritic complex spikes can serve coincidence detection, these cortical interneuronal circuits may be essential for salience selection.},

Small molecules that potentiate AMPA receptor currents relieve cognitive deficits caused by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and show promise in the treatment of depression. Previously, there has been limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of action for AMPA receptor potentiators. Here we present cocrystal structures of the glutamate receptor GluR2 S1S2 ligand-binding domain in complex with aniracetam [1-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-2-pyrrolidinone] or CX614 (pyrrolidino-1,3-oxazino benzo-1,4-dioxan-10-one), two AMPA receptor potentiators that preferentially slow AMPA receptor deactivation. Both potentiators bind within the dimer interface of the nondesensitized receptor at a common site located on the twofold axis of molecular symmetry. Importantly, the potentiator binding site is adjacent to the "hinge" in the ligand-binding core "clamshell" that undergoes conformational rearrangement after glutamate binding. Using rapid solution exchange, patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments, we show that point mutations of residues that interact with potentiators in the cocrystal disrupt potentiator function. We suggest that the potentiators slow deactivation by stabilizing the clamshell in its closed-cleft, glutamate-bound conformation.},

  abstract    = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of photic and auditory stimuli on brain functions in schizophrenics by investigating the functional cluster (FC) of EEGs. We recorded EEGs using 16 electrodes on 10 schizophrenic patients and on 10 normal controls during photic and auditory stimuli. We estimated FC would characterize the strongly interactive brain regions among many brain regions. FC refers to the brain regions that interact much more strongly among themselves than with the rest of the brain. Brain regions that belong to the same cluster are therefore all functionally involved while, presumably, the regions that belong to separate clusters are functionally unrelated. When photic and auditory stimuli are applied, the schizophrenic patients have a very similar cluster composed of the right temporal and occipital regions for both conditions, whereas the normal controls show the normally driven information stream from the posterior areas to the prefrontal cortex. Our findings may suggest that in schizophrenics the right temporal and occipital regions strongly interact with neuronal activities not only in the resting condition but also during the stimulation condition. In addition, this strong interaction supports the abnormal brain functional connectivity and the dysfunction of the cortical structure during photic and auditory stimuli. Our study shows the existence and different pattern of FCs for normal controls and schizophrenics. Thus, FC analysis would be a potential tool to investigate the simultaneous neuronal activity of human EEGs.},

  abstract    = {Reduced amplitudes of auditory evoked mismatch negativity (MMN) have often been found in schizophrenic patients, indicating deficient auditory information processing and working memory. Cannabis-induced psychotic states may resemble schizophrenia. Currently, there are discussions focusing on the close relationship between cannabis, the endocannabinoid and dopaminergic system, and the onset of schizophrenic psychosis. This study investigated the effects of cannabis on MMN amplitude in 22 healthy volunteers (age 28+/-6 years, 11 male) by comparing Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and standardized cannabis extract containing Delta(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design. The MMNs resulting from 1000 auditory stimuli were recorded by 32 channel EEG. The standard stimuli were 1000 Hz, 80 dB SPL, and 100 ms duration. The deviant stimuli differed in frequency (1500 Hz). Significantly greater MMN amplitude values at central electrodes were found under cannabis extract, but not under Delta(9)-THC. There were no significant differences between MMN amplitudes at frontal electrodes. MMN amplitudes at central electrodes were significantly correlated with 11-OH-THC concentration, the most important psychoactive metabolite of Delta(9)-THC. Since the main difference between Delta(9)-THC and standardized cannabis extract is CBD, which seems to have neuroprotective and anti-psychotic properties, it can be speculated whether the greater MMN amplitude that may imply higher cortical activation and cognitive performance is related to the positive effects of CBD. This effect may be relevant for auditory cortex activity in particular because only MMN amplitudes at the central, but not at the frontal electrodes were enhanced under cannabis.},

  abstract    = {Since the first reports in 2001, great advances have been made towards the understanding of endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic modulation. Electrophysiological studies have revealed that one of the two major endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is produced from membrane lipids upon postsynaptic Ca(2+) elevation and/or activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors, and released from postsynaptic neurons. The released 2-AG then acts retrogradely onto presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors and induces suppression of neurotransmitter release either transiently or persistently. These forms of 2-AG-mediated retrograde synaptic modulation are functional throughout the brain. The other major endocannabinoid, anandamide, mediates a certain form of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (LTD). Anandamide also functions as an agonist for transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) and mediates endocannabinoid-independent and TRPV1-dependent forms of LTD. It has also been demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system itself is plastic, which can be either up- or down-regulated by experimental or environmental conditions. In this review, I will make an overview of the mechanisms underlying endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic modulation.},

  abstract    = {The discovery of cannabinoid receptors and subsequent identification of their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) in early 1990s have greatly accelerated research on cannabinoid actions in the brain. Then, the discovery in 2001 that endocannabinoids mediate retrograde synaptic signaling has opened up a new era for cannabinoid research and also established a new concept how diffusible messengers modulate synaptic efficacy and neural activity. The last 7 years have witnessed remarkable advances in our understanding of the endocannabinoid system. It is now well accepted that endocannabinoids are released from postsynaptic neurons, activate presynaptic cannabinoid CB(1) receptors, and cause transient and long-lasting reduction of neurotransmitter release. In this review, we aim to integrate our current understanding of functions of the endocannabinoid system, especially focusing on the control of synaptic transmission in the brain. We summarize recent electrophysiological studies carried out on synapses of various brain regions and discuss how synaptic transmission is regulated by endocannabinoid signaling. Then we refer to recent anatomical studies on subcellular distribution of the molecules involved in endocannabinoid signaling and discuss how these signaling molecules are arranged around synapses. In addition, we make a brief overview of studies on cannabinoid receptors and their intracellular signaling, biochemical studies on endocannabinoid metabolism, and behavioral studies on the roles of the endocannabinoid system in various aspects of neural functions.},

But a model for that has been missing. We propose that inherently stochastic features of synaptic plasticity and spine motility enable cortical networks of neurons to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior distribution of network configurations. This model provides a viable alternative to existing models that propose convergence of parameters to maximum likelihood values. It explains how priors on weight distributions and connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience, how cortical networks can generalize learned information so well to novel experiences, and how they can compensate continuously for unforeseen disturbances of the network. The resulting new theory of network plasticity explains from a functional perspective a number of experimental data on stochastic aspects of synaptic plasticity that previously appeared to be quite puzzling.},

  abstract    = {GABAA-mediated IPSCs in piriform cortex have fast and slow components with different properties and locations on pyramidal cells. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2531-2545, 1997. A recent study in piriform (olfactory) cortex provided evidence that, as in hippocampus and neocortex, gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA)-mediated inhibition is generated in dendrites of pyramidal cells, not just in the somatic region as previously believed. This study examines selected properties of GABAA inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in dendritic and somatic regions that could provide insight into their functional roles. Pharmacologically isolated GABAA-mediated IPSCs were studied by whole cell patch recording in slices. To compare properties of IPSCs in distal dendritic and somatic regions, local stimulation was carried out with tungsten microelectrodes, and spatially restricted blockade of GABAA-mediated inhibition was achieved by pressure-ejection of bicuculline from micropipettes. The results revealed that largely independent circuits generate GABAA inhibition in distal apical dendritic and somatic regions. With such independence, a selective decrease in dendritic-region inhibition could enhance integrative or plastic processes in dendrites while allowing feedback inhibition in the somatic region to restrain system excitability. This could allow modulatory fiber systems from the basal forebrain or brain stem, for example, to change the functional state of the cortex by altering the excitability of interneurons that mediate dendritic inhibition without increasing the propensity for regenerative bursting in this highly epileptogenic system. As in hippocampus, GABAA-mediated IPSCs were found to have fast and slow components with time constants of decay on the order of 10 and 40 ms, respectively, at 29 degrees C. Modeling analysis supported physiological evidence that the slow time constant represents a true IPSC component rather than an artifactual slowing of the fast component from voltage clamp of a dendritic current. The results indicated that, whereas both dendritic and somatic-region IPSCs have both fast and slow GABAA components, there is a greater proportion of the slow component in dendrites. In a companion paper, the hypothesis is explored that the resulting slower time course of the dendritic IPSC increases its capacity to regulate the N-methyl--aspartate component of EPSPs. Finally, evidence is presented that the slow GABAA-mediated IPSC component is regulated by presynaptic GABAB inhibition whereas the fast is not. Based on the requirement for presynaptic GABAB-mediated block of inhibition for expression of long-term potentiation, this finding is consistent with participation of the slow GABAA component in regulation of synaptic plasticity. The lack of susceptibility of the fast GABAA component to the long-lasting, activity-induced suppression mediated by presynaptic GABAB receptors is consistent with a protective role for this process in preventing seizure activity.},

Here we extended these observations to mice brain and examined the potential involvement of {5-HT(2A)} and {5-HT(1A)} receptors {(5-HT(2A)R} and {5-HT(1A)R}, respectively) in the reversal by clozapine of {PCP} actions.

  abstract  = {{NMDA} receptor {(NMDA-R)} antagonists are extensively used as schizophrenia models because of their ability to evoke positive and negative symptoms as well as cognitive deficits similar to those of the illness. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with prefrontal cortex {(PFC)} abnormalities. These deficits are of particular interest because an early improvement in cognitive performance predicts a better long-term clinical outcome. Here, we examined the effect of the noncompetitive {NMDA-R} antagonist phencyclidine {(PCP)} on {PFC} function to understand the cellular and network elements involved in its schizomimetic actions. {PCP} induces a marked disruption of the activity of the {PFC} in the rat, increasing and decreasing the activity of 45\% and 33\% of the pyramidal neurons recorded, respectively (22\% of the neurons were unaffected). Concurrently, {PCP} markedly reduced cortical synchrony in the delta frequency range (0.3-4 Hz) as assessed by recording local field potentials. The subsequent administration of the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and clozapine reversed {PCP} effects on pyramidal cell firing and cortical synchronization. {PCP} increased c-fos expression in {PFC} pyramidal neurons, an effect prevented by the administration of clozapine. {PCP} also enhanced c-fos expression in the centromedial and mediodorsal (but not reticular) nuclei of the thalamus, suggesting the participation of enhanced thalamocortical excitatory inputs. These results shed light on the involvement of {PFC} in the schizomimetic action of {NMDA-R} antagonists and show that antipsychotic drugs may partly exert their therapeutic effect by normalizing a disrupted {PFC} activity, an effect that may add to subcortical dopamine receptor blockade.},

Triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed numerous axosomatic, axodendritic, and axoaxonic contacts stained for CCK, PV, and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. The existence of mutual CCK and PV synapses was supported by dual EM immunolabeling. Paired whole-cell recordings detected unitary GABA(A)ergic synaptic transmission between identified CCK and PV cells, and single CCK cells could transiently inhibit action potential firing of synaptically coupled PV cells. We conclude that the major hippocampal perisomatic-targeting interneurons communicate synaptically. This communication should affect neuronal network activity, including neuronal oscillations, in which the CCK and PV cells have well established roles. The prevalence of CCK and PV networks in other brain regions suggests that internetwork interactions could be generally important.},

In the present study, interneurons identical to these cell populations were visualized by somatostatin-immunostaining, then reconstructed, and processed for double-immunostaining and electron microscopy to establish their postsynaptic target selectivity. A combination of somatostatin-immunostaining with immunostaining for {GABA} or other interneuron markers revealed a quasi-random termination pattern. The vast majority of postsynaptic targets were {GABA-negative} dendritic shafts and spines of principal cells (76\%), whereas other target elements contained {GABA} (8\%). All of the examined neurochemically defined interneuron types (parvalbumin-, calretinin-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, cholecystokinin-, substance P receptor-immunoreactive neurons) received innervation from somatostatin-positive boutons. Recent anatomical and electrophysiological data showed that the main excitatory inputs of somatostatin-positive interneurons originate from local principal cells. The present data revealed a massive {GABAergic} innervation of distal dendrites of local principal cells by these feedback driven neurons, which are proposed to control the efficacy and plasticity of entorhinal synaptic input as a function of local principal cell activity and synchrony.},

  abstract    = {Despite being regarded as a hippie science for decades, cannabinoid research has finally found its well-deserved position in mainstream neuroscience. A series of groundbreaking discoveries revealed that endocannabinoid molecules are as widespread and important as conventional neurotransmitters such as glutamate or GABA, yet they act in profoundly unconventional ways. We aim to illustrate how uncovering the molecular, anatomical, and physiological characteristics of endocannabinoid signaling has revealed new mechanistic insights into several fundamental phenomena in synaptic physiology. First, we summarize unexpected advances in the molecular complexity of biogenesis and inactivation of the two endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Then, we show how these new metabolic routes are integrated into well-known intracellular signaling pathways. These endocannabinoid-producing signalosomes operate in phasic and tonic modes, thereby differentially governing homeostatic, short-term, and long-term synaptic plasticity throughout the brain. Finally, we discuss how cell type- and synapse-specific refinement of endocannabinoid signaling may explain the characteristic behavioral effects of cannabinoids.},

Although the CB1 neuronal cannabinoid receptor was identified several years ago, neuronal network mechanisms mediating cannabinoid effects are still controversial in animals, and even more obscure in humans. In the present study, the localization of CB1 receptors was investigated at the cellular and subcellular levels in the human hippocampus, using control post mortem and epileptic lobectomy tissue. The latter tissue was also used for [3H]GABA release experiments, testing the predictions of the anatomical data. Detectable expression of CB1 was confined to interneurons, most of which were found to be cholecystokinin-containing basket cells. CB1-positive cell bodies showed immunostaining in their perinuclear cytoplasm, but not in their somadendritic plasmamembrane. CB1-immunoreactive axon terminals densely covered the entire hippocampus, forming symmetrical synapses characteristic of GABAergic boutons. Human temporal lobectomy samples were used in the release experiments, as they were similar to the controls regarding cellular and subcellular distribution of CB1 receptors. We found that the CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, strongly reduced [3H]GABA release, and this effect was fully prevented by the specific CB1 receptor antagonist SR 141716A. This unique expression pattern and the presynaptic modulation of GABA release suggests a conserved role for CB1 receptors in controlling inhibitory networks of the hippocampus that are responsible for the generation and maintenance of fast and slow oscillatory patterns. Therefore, a likely mechanism by which cannabinoids may impair memory and associational processes is an alteration of the fine-tuning of synchronized, rhythmic population events.},

  abstract    = {To understand the functional significance and mechanisms of action in the CNS of endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids, it is crucial to identify the neural elements that serve as the structural substrate of these actions. We used a recently developed antibody against the CB1 cannabinoid receptor to study this question in hippocampal networks. Interneurons with features typical of basket cells showed a selective, intense staining for CB1 in all hippocampal subfields and layers. Most of them (85.6\%) contained cholecystokinin (CCK), which corresponded to 96.9\% of all CCK-positive interneurons, whereas only 4.6\% of the parvalbumin (PV)-containing basket cells expressed CB1. Accordingly, electron microscopy revealed that CB1-immunoreactive axon terminals of CCK-containing basket cells surrounded the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, whereas PV-positive basket cell terminals in similar locations were negative for CB1. The synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (0.01-3 microM) reduced dose-dependently the electrical field stimulation-induced [3H]GABA release from superfused hippocampal slices, with an EC50 value of 0. 041 microM. Inhibition of GABA release by WIN 55,212-2 was not mediated by inhibition of glutamatergic transmission because the WIN 55,212-2 effect was not reduced by the glutamate blockers AP5 and CNQX. In contrast, the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A (1 microM) prevented this effect, whereas by itself it did not change the outflow of [3H]GABA. These results suggest that cannabinoid-mediated modulation of hippocampal interneuron networks operate largely via presynaptic receptors on CCK-immunoreactive basket cell terminals. Reduction of GABA release from these terminals is the likely mechanism by which both endogenous and exogenous CB1 ligands interfere with hippocampal network oscillations and associated cognitive functions.},

  abstract    = {Endocannabinoids play central roles in retrograde signaling at a wide variety of synapses throughout the CNS. Although several molecular components of the endocannabinoid system have been identified recently, their precise location and contribution to retrograde synaptic signaling is essentially unknown. Here we show, by using two independent riboprobes, that principal cell populations of the hippocampus express high levels of diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DGL-alpha), the enzyme involved in generation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). Immunostaining with two independent antibodies against DGL-alpha revealed that this lipase was concentrated in heads of dendritic spines throughout the hippocampal formation. Furthermore, quantification of high-resolution immunoelectron microscopic data showed that this enzyme was highly compartmentalized into a wide perisynaptic annulus around the postsynaptic density of axospinous contacts but did not occur intrasynaptically. On the opposite side of the synapse, the axon terminals forming these excitatory contacts were found to be equipped with presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. This precise anatomical positioning suggests that 2-AG produced by DGL-alpha on spine heads may be involved in retrograde synaptic signaling at glutamatergic synapses, whereas CB1 receptors located on the afferent terminals are in an ideal position to bind 2-AG and thereby adjust presynaptic glutamate release as a function of postsynaptic activity. We propose that this molecular composition of the endocannabinoid system may be a general feature of most glutamatergic synapses throughout the brain and may contribute to homosynaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses and to heterosynaptic plasticity between excitatory and inhibitory contacts.},

With respect to acute psychotropic effects, the aim of this study is the comparison of an oral cannabis extract and low-dose diazepam in a cross-over experiment in drug-naïve healthy women.Sixteen healthy females participated in this randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, single-dose, balanced 2-way cross-over study. Cannabis extract with standardised Delta (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content (20 mg) or active placebo (5 mg diazepam) was administered orally. Subjects were assessed by self- and observer-rated visual analogue scales (VAS), the BRIEF PSYCHIATRIC RATING SCALE (BPRS) and three psychomotor tests up to 6 h after administration.VAS showed significantly elevated fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and "feeling high" after cannabis as compared to baseline and diazepam. BPRS scores were significantly higher after cannabis intake. Only in one psychomotor test a decrease of psychomotor activity after cannabis was evident. One subject in the cannabis condition experienced severe transient psychotic symptoms.Orally administered cannabis produced significant central depressant side-effects compared to diazepam, mostly subjective effects (VAS) but marginal effects in psychomotor performance in 15 healthy females. Regarding the medical use of cannabis, a rigorous benefit-risk analysis and an exact psychiatric assessment before and during treatment are necessary.},

  abstract    = {Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that a single subpsychotomimetic dose of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, produces a rapid antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder, with effects lasting up to 2 weeks. Despite enthusiasm about this unexpected efficacy of ketamine, its widespread use as a fast-acting antidepressant in routine clinical settings is curtailed by its abuse potential as well as possible psychotomimetic effects. However, the ability of ketamine to produce a rapid and long-lasting antidepressant response in patients with depression provides a unique opportunity for investigation of mechanisms that mediate these clinically relevant behavioral effects. From a mechanistic perspective, it is easy to imagine how activation of NMDA receptors may trigger cellular and behavioral responses; it is relatively more difficult, however, to envision how transient blockade of one of the key pathways for neuronal communication produces a persistent beneficial effect. The authors discuss recent work linking ketamine's mechanism of action to homeostatic synaptic plasticity processes activated after suppression of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. They focus on their recent work demonstrating that ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDA receptors at rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, resulting in reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and desuppression of rapid dendritic protein translation, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), which then contributes to synaptic plasticity mechanisms that mediate longterm effects of the drug. The authors also explore possible molecular strategies to target spontaneous neurotransmitter release selectively to help uncover novel presynaptic avenues for the development of fast-acting antidepressants and possibly psychoactive compounds with effectiveness against other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

We have divided GABA cells in the rat frontal cortex into 3 groups, based on their firing characteristics: fast-spiking (FS) cells, late-spiking (LS) cells, and non-FS cells. Expression of calcium-binding proteins and peptides could be shown in separate groups of GABA cells in layers II/III and V of the frontal cortex: (1) parvalbumin cells, (2) somatostatin cells, (3) calretinin and/or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) cells [partially positive for cholecystokinin (CCK)] and (4) large CCK cells (almost negative for VIP/calretinin). Combining the physiological and chemical properties of morphologically diverse nonpyramidal cells allows division into several groups, including FS basket cells containing parvalbumin, non-FS somatostatin Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors, and non-FS large basket cells positive for CCK. These subtypes show characteristic spatial distributions of axon collaterals and the innervation tendency of postsynaptic elements. With synchronized activity induced by cortical excitatory or inhibitory circuits, firing patterns were also found to differ. Subtype-selective occurrence of electrical coupling, finding for potassium channel Kv3.1 proteins, and cholinergic and serotonergic modulation supports our tentative classification. To clarify the functional architecture in the frontal cortex, it is important to reveal the connectional characteristics of GABA cell subtypes and determine whether they are similar to those in other cortical regions.},

Both these physiological types corresponded to a range of morphologies: (i) somatostatin-containing Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors to layer I (some were also positive for calbindin D28k); (ii) VIP-containing double bouquet cells with descending axonal arbors as well as arcade cells (these included small cells immunoreactive for CCK or calretinin).

These three peptides were expressed in separate populations including large cells. Cholecystokinin cells and parvalbumin cells made boutons apposed to other cell bodies, but differed in their firing patterns in response to depolarizing current pulses. Parvalbumin cells belonged to fast-spiking cells. Parvalbumin fast-spiking cells also included chandelier cells. In contrast, cholecystokinin cells were found to be regular-spiking non-pyramidal cells or burst-spiking non-pyramidal cells with bursting activity from hyperpolarized potentials (two or more spikes on slow depolarizing humps). Large somatostatin cells belonged to the regular-spiking non-pyramidal category and featured wide or ascending axonal arbors (wide arbor cells and Martinotti cells) which did not seem to be apposed to the somata so frequently as large cholecystokinin and parvalbumin cells. For electron microscopic observations, another population of eight immunohistochemically-uncharacterized non-pyramidal cells were selected: (i) five fast spiking cells including one chandelier cell which are supposed to contain parvalbumin, and (ii) three large regular-spiking non-pyramidal cells with terminals apposed to somata, which are not considered to include somatostatin cells, but some of which may belong to cholecystokinin cells. The fast-spiking cells other than a chandelier cell and the large regular-spiking non-pyramidal cells made GABA-positive synapses on somata (4\% and 12\% of the synapses in two small to medium fast-spiking cells, 22\% and 35\% of the synapses in two large fast-spiking cells, and 10\%, 18\% and 37\% of the synapses in three large regular-spiking non-pyramidal cells). A few terminals of the fast-spiking and regular-spiking non-pyramidal cells innervated GABAergic cells. About 30\% of the fast-spiking cell terminals innervated spines, but few of the regular-spiking non-pyramidal cell terminals did. A fast-spiking chandelier cell made GABA-positive synapses on GABA-negative axon initial segments. These results suggest that large GABAergic cells are heterogeneous in neuroactive substances, firing patterns and synaptic connections, and that cortical cells receive heterogeneous GABAergic somatic inputs.},

A single subcutaneous administration of HAL (0.25 mg/kg), YM (0.1 mg/kg), or SUL (250 mg/kg) significantly reduced the basal CCK-LI in mPFC by 20-40\%; a selective D1 antagonist, SCH (up to 1.0 mg/kg), had no effect on basal CCK-LI. However, the reduction of CCK-LI induced by MAP (20-40\%) was abolished by the pretreatment with HAL (0.025 and 0.25 mg/kg), YM (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), or SCH (1.0 mg/kg), without being affected by SUL (up to 250 mg/kg). This effect of DA antagonists on MAP-induced change in CCK-LI was associated with an inhibition of MAP-induced stereotyped behaviors. These data suggest that the CCK-containing neurons in rat mPFC are functionally related to the mesocortical DA system and may participate in a development of abnormal behaviors induced by MAP.},

  abstract    = {Endocannabinoids work as retrograde messengers and contribute to short-term and long-term modulation of synaptic transmission via presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. It is generally accepted that the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) mediates the effects of endocannabinoid in inhibitory synapses. For excitatory synapses, however, contributions of CB1, "CB3," and some other unidentified receptors have been suggested. In the present study we used electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques and examined the type(s) of cannabinoid receptor functioning at hippocampal and cerebellar excitatory synapses. Our electrophysiological data clearly demonstrate the predominant contribution of CB1. At hippocampal excitatory synapses on pyramidal neurons the cannabinoid-induced synaptic suppression was reversed by a CB1-specific antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251), and was absent in CB1 knock-out mice. At climbing fiber (CF) and parallel fiber (PF) synapses on cerebellar Purkinje cells the cannabinoid-dependent suppression was absent in CB1 knock-out mice. The presence of CB1 at presynaptic terminals was confirmed by immunohistochemical experiments with specific antibodies against CB1. In immunoelectron microscopy the densities of CB1-positive signals in hippocampal excitatory terminals and cerebellar PF terminals were much lower than in inhibitory terminals but were clearly higher than the background. Along the long axis of PFs, the CB1 was localized at a much higher density on the perisynaptic membrane than on the extrasynaptic and synaptic regions. In contrast, CB1 density was low in CF terminals and was not significantly higher than the background. Despite the discrepancy between the electrophysiological and morphological data for CB1 expression on CFs, these results collectively indicate that CB1 is responsible for cannabinoid-dependent suppression of excitatory transmission in the hippocampus and cerebellum.},

Basket cells, the main class of interneurons, target pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites and thus are poised to modify network oscillations. Though only present in limited numbers, the impaired development of basket cells can result in changes in the hippocampal circuitry leading to neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia. The diversity of the spatial origins, neurochemical make-up, cytoarchitecture and network contributions amongst basket cells is a provocative example of interneuron heterogeneity in the hippocampus. This review discusses recent data concerned with the developmental trajectories of one subclass, the cholecystokinin-containing basket cell, and emphasizes the significance of the short-range intercellular guidance cues that have recently emerged to impact the formation and function of their inhibitory synapses.},

  abstract    = {Understanding brain circuits begins with an appreciation of their component parts - the cells. Although GABAergic interneurons are a minority population within the brain, they are crucial for the control of inhibition. Determining the diversity of these interneurons has been a central goal of neurobiologists, but this amazing cell type has so far defied a generalized classification system. Interneuron complexity within the telencephalon could be simplified by viewing them as elaborations of a much more finite group of developmentally specified cardinal classes that become further specialized as they mature. Our perspective emphasizes that the ultimate goal is to dispense with classification criteria and directly define interneuron types by function.},

  abstract    = {The basal ganglia play a crucial role in the execution of movements, as demonstrated by the severe motor deficits that accompany Parkinson's disease (PD). Since motor commands originate in the cortex, an important question is how the basal ganglia influence cortical information flow, and how this influence becomes pathological in PD. To explore this, we developed a composite neuronal network/neural field model. The network model consisted of 4950 spiking neurons, divided into 15 excitatory and inhibitory cell populations in the thalamus and cortex. The field model consisted of the cortex, thalamus, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus. Both models have been separately validated in previous work. Three field models were used: one with basal ganglia parameters based on data from healthy individuals, one based on data from individuals with PD, and one purely thalamocortical model. Spikes generated by these field models were then used to drive the network model. Compared to the network driven by the healthy model, the PD-driven network had lower firing rates, a shift in spectral power toward lower frequencies, and higher probability of bursting; each of these findings is consistent with empirical data on PD. In the healthy model, we found strong Granger causality between cortical layers in the beta and low gamma frequency bands, but this causality was largely absent in the PD model. In particular, the reduction in Granger causality from the main "input" layer of the cortex (layer 4) to the main "output" layer (layer 5) was pronounced. This may account for symptoms of PD that seem to reflect deficits in information flow, such as bradykinesia. In general, these results demonstrate that the brain's large-scale oscillatory environment, represented here by the field model, strongly influences the information processing that occurs within its subnetworks. Hence, it may be preferable to drive spiking network models with physiologically realistic inputs rather than pure white noise.},

The activity of septal and hippocampal neurons is modulated by several neurotransmitter systems including glutamatergic neurons from the entorhinal cortex, serotonergic fibers from the raphe nucleus, dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), histaminergic cells from the tuberomammillary nucleus and adrenergic fibers from the locus coeruleus (LC).

  abstract    = {Both the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1) and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) are G protein-coupled receptors that are linked to inhibitory Gαi/o protein, whereby activation of the receptor leads to the inhibition of cAMP production. Moreover, previous findings have shown evidence of cross-talk between the dopamine and endocannabinoid systems. In this report, we confirm the interaction of CB1 and D2R with co-immunoprecipitation experiments using human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK-293T) cells co-expressing both receptors. We also generated GST and His-tagged fusion proteins of the D2R and CB1 and conducted affinity purification assays and in vitro binding experiments to show that the CB1-D2R complex can be formed by a direct protein-protein interaction. This interaction is mediated by the carboxyl terminus of the CB1 receptor and the third intracellular loop of the D2 receptor. Co-transfection of an inhibitory mini-gene resulted in decreased levels of the CB1-D2R complex. Using a cAMP biosensor, we show that activation of D2R or CB1 alone in HEK-293T cells co-expressing both receptors leads to an inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. However, co-activation of both receptors resulted in a loss of this inhibition on cAMP accumulation. Our findings characterize the physical interaction between CB1 and D2R as well as demonstrate the potential functional outcome of the receptor complex.},

  abstract    = {Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is considered to be an important factor contributing to a decrease in cognitive performance of schizophrenia patients. The medial PFC (mPFC) is innervated by the hippocampus/subiculum, and the subiculum-mPFC pathway is known to be involved in various cognitive processes. Glutamate-containing subicular axons innervate cortical pyramidal neurons and interneurons where AMPA and NMDA receptors are implicated in synaptic transmission. In our experiments, properties of subiculum-mPFC interactions were studied using pathway stimulation and local field potential (LFP) recordings of the mPFC in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Changes in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and LFP oscillations, effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, and the AMPAkine LY451395 were evaluated. Effects of disruption of the thalamo-cortical loop with local microinjection of lidocaine into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) were also studied. Our findings demonstrate that both systemic administration of MK-801 and local MD lidocaine microinjection produce similar changes in LFP oscillations and reduction in PPF. Specifically, it was observed that MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg i.v.) and intra-thalamic lidocaine changed regular, 2 Hz delta oscillation to a less regular 0.5-1.5 Hz delta rhythm. Concurrently, PPF in response to electrical stimulation of the subiculum was significantly attenuated. Administration of the AMPAkine LY451395 (0.01 mg/kg i.v.) reversed the MK-801- and lidocaine-induced changes, and was itself blocked by the AMPA receptor antagonist CP-465022. Analysis of our findings suggests a critical role of cortical interneurons in NMDA/AMPA receptor-mediated changes in thalamo-cortical oscillations and PPF, and contributes to our understanding of the NMDA hypofunction model of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, such as phencyclidine, ketamine, or dizocilpine (MK-801) are commonly used in psychiatric drug discovery in order to model several symptoms of schizophrenia, including psychosis and impairments in working memory. In spite of the widespread use of NMDAR antagonists in preclinical and clinical studies, our understanding of the mode of action of these drugs on brain circuits and neuronal networks is still limited. In the present study spontaneous local field potential (LFP), multi- (MUA) and single-unit activity, and evoked potential, including paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in response to electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral subiculum were carried out in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in urethane anesthetized rats. Systemic administration of MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased overall MUA, with a diverse effect on single-unit activity, including increased, decreased, or unchanged firing, and in line with our previous findings shifted delta-frequency power of the LFP and disrupted PPF (Kiss et al., 2011). In order to provide further insight to the mechanisms of action of NMDAR antagonists, MK-801 was administered intracranially into the mPFC and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD). Microinjections of MK-801, but not physiological saline, localized into the MD evoked changes in both LFP parameters and PPF similar to the effects of systemically administered MK-801. Local microinjection of MK-801 into the mPFC was without effect on these parameters. Our findings indicate that the primary site of the action of systemic administration of NMDAR antagonists is unlikely to be the cortex. We presume that multiple neuronal networks, involving thalamic nuclei contribute to disrupted behavior and cognition following NMDAR blockade.},

It is well-documented that intrinsic neuronal oscillations and provided by them communications between brain structures are of importance for cognition. Epilepsy disturbs these brain rhythms and presumably therefore affects memory. Here we review studies on cellular and systemic levels devoted to the TLE-induced disturbance of theta oscillations in the septohippocampal system. Special attention is paid to the role of damage of septal and hippocampal GABAergic cells in theta activity abnormalities. We also compare differences between native (in vivo) theta oscillations with those obtained in in vitro preparations of hippocampus and medial septum and find that in vitro they resemble epileptiform activity in some respects.},

  abstract    = {The proper organization and function of GABAergic interneuron networks is essential for many cognitive processes and abnormalities in these systems have been documented in schizophrenic patients. The memory function of the hippocampus depends on two major patterns of oscillations in the theta and gamma ranges, both requiring the intact functioning of the network of fast-firing interneurons expressing parvalbumin. We examined the ability of acute and chronic administration of NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists to recapitulate the oscillatory dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia. In freely moving rats, acute injection of MK801 or ketamine increased gamma power in both CA1 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Theta peak shifted to higher frequencies whereas the average 5-10 Hz theta power decreased by 24\% in CA1 and remained high in the dentate gyrus. Strong increase in CA1 gamma and decrease in theta power triggered by brainstem stimulation were found under urethane anesthesia. In contrast to acute experiments, chronic administration of ketamine caused a steady decline in both gamma and theta oscillations, 2-4 weeks after treatment. A further important difference between the two models was that the effects of acute injection were more robust than the changes after chronic treatment. Chronic administration of ketamine also leads to decrease in the number of detectable parvalbumin interneurons. Histological examination of interindividual differences indicated, however, that within the ketamine treated group a further decrease in parvalbumin neurons correlated with strengthening of oscillations. The findings are consistent with abnormalities of oscillations in human schizophrenia and further validate the NMDA-R hypofunction hypothesis.},

  abstract    = {In the hippocampal CA1 area, a relatively homogenous population of pyramidal cells is accompanied by a diversity of GABAergic interneurons. Previously, we found that parvalbumin-expressing basket, axo-axonic, bistratified, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells, innervating different domains of pyramidal cells, have distinct firing patterns during network oscillations in vivo. A second family of interneurons, expressing cholecystokinin but not parvalbumin, is known to target the same domains of pyramidal cells as do the parvalbumin cells. To test the temporal activity of these independent and parallel GABAergic inputs, we recorded the precise spike timing of identified cholecystokinin interneurons during hippocampal network oscillations in anesthetized rats and determined their molecular expression profiles and synaptic targets. The cells were cannabinoid receptor type 1 immunopositive. Contrary to the stereotyped firing of parvalbumin interneurons, cholecystokinin-expressing basket and dendrite-innervating cells discharge, on average, with 1.7 +/- 2.0 Hz during high-frequency ripple oscillations in an episode-dependent manner. During theta oscillations, cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons fire with 8.8 +/- 3.3 Hz at a characteristic time on the ascending phase of theta waves (155 +/- 81 degrees), when place cells start firing in freely moving animals. The firing patterns of some interneurons recorded in drug-free behaving rats were similar to cholecystokinin cells in anesthetized animals. Our results demonstrate that cholecystokinin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons make different contributions to network oscillations and play distinct roles in different brain states. We suggest that the specific spike timing of cholecystokinin interneurons and their sensitivity to endocannabinoids might contribute to differentiate subgroups of pyramidal cells forming neuronal assemblies, whereas parvalbumin interneurons contribute to synchronizing the entire network.},

Recent advances reveal a spatiotemporal division of labor in cortical circuits, as exemplified in the CA1 hippocampal area. In particular, distinct GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing) cell types subdivide the surface of pyramidal cells and act in discrete time windows, either on the same or on different subcellular compartments. They also interact with glutamatergic pyramidal cell inputs in a domain-specific manner and support synaptic temporal dynamics, network oscillations, selection of cell assemblies, and the implementation of brain states. The spatiotemporal specializations in cortical circuits reveal that cellular diversity and temporal dynamics coemerged during evolution, providing a basis for cognitive behavior.},

  abstract    = {Δ⁹-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produces transient psychomimetic effects in healthy volunteers, constituting a pharmacological model for psychosis. The dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol has previously been shown to reduce these effects. This placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 49 healthy, male, mild cannabis users aimed to further explore this model by examining the effect of a single oral dose of olanzapine (with dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, muscarinergic and histaminergic properties) or two oral doses of diphenhydramine (histamine antagonist) on the effects of intrapulmonarily administered THC. Transient psychomimetic symptoms were seen after THC administration, as measured on the positive and negative syndrome scale (20.6\% increase on positive subscale, p<0.001) and the visual analogue scale for psychedelic effects (increase of 10.7 mm on feeling high). Following the combination of THC and olanzapine, the positive subscale increased by only 13.7\% and feeling high by only 8.7 mm. This reduction of THC effects on the positive subscale failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.066). However, one-third of the subjects did not show an increase in psychomimetic symptoms after THC alone. Within responders, olanzapine reduced the effects of THC on the positive subscale (p=0.005). Other outcome measures included pharmacokinetics, eye movements, postural stability, pupil/iris ratio, and serum concentrations of cortisol and prolactin.},

  abstract    = {This analysis examines the neuronal foundation of drug-induced psychomimetic symptoms by relating the severity of these symptoms to changes in functional connectivity for a range of different psychoactive compounds with varying degrees of psychomimetic effects. The repeated measures design included 323 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging time series and measures of subjective effects in 36 healthy male volunteers. Four different pharmacological challenges with ethanol, morphine, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and ketamine (12 subjects per drug) were applied. A set of 10 "template" resting-state networks was used to determine individual connectivity maps. Linear regression was used for each individual subject to relate these connectivity maps to three clusters of drug-induced subjective psychomimetic effects ("perception," "relaxation," and "dysphoria") as measured with visual analogue scales. Group analysis showed that the subjective effects of perception correlated significantly across drugs with the connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex and precentral gyrus with the sensorimotor network (p < 0.005, corrected). No significant correlations were found for relaxation or dysphoria. The posterior cingulate cortex has a role in visuospatial evaluation and the precentral gyrus has been associated with auditory hallucinations. Both the posterior cingulate cortex and the precentral gyrus show changes in activation in patients with schizophrenia, which can be related to the severity of positive symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), and have previously been related to changes induced by psychoactive drugs. The similarity of functional connectivity changes for drug-induced psychomimetic effects and symptoms of psychosis provides further support for the use of pharmacological challenges with psychomimetic drugs as models for psychosis.},

  abstract    = {Resting state-functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-FMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that allows repeated assessments of functional connectivity in resting state. While task-related FMRI is limited to indirectly measured drug effects in areas affected by the task, resting state can show direct CNS effects across all brain networks. Hence, RS-FMRI could be an objective measure for compounds affecting the CNS. Several studies on the effects of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB(1))-receptor agonist δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on task-dependent FMRI have been performed. However, no studies on the effects of cannabinoids on resting state networks using RS-FMRI have been published. Therefore, we investigated the effects of THC on functional brain connectivity using RS-FMRI. Twelve healthy volunteers (9 male, 3 female) inhaled 2, 6 and 6 mg THC or placebo with 90-minute intervals in a randomized, double blind, cross-over trial. Eight RS-FMRI scans of 8 min were obtained per occasion. Subjects rated subjective psychedelic effects on a visual analog scale after each scan, as pharmacodynamic effect measures. Drug-induced effects on functional connectivity were examined using dual regression with FSL software (FMRIB Analysis Group, Oxford). Eight maps of voxel-wise connectivity throughout the entire brain were provided per RS-FMRI series with eight predefined resting-state networks of interest. These maps were used in a mixed effects model group analysis to determine brain regions with a statistically significant drug-by-time interaction. Statistical images were cluster-corrected, and results were Bonferroni-corrected across multiple contrasts. THC administration increased functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network, and was associated with dissociable lateralized connectivity changes in the right and left dorsal visual stream networks. The brain regions showing connectivity changes included the cerebellum and dorsal frontal cortical regions. Clear increases were found for feeling high, external perception, heart rate and cortisol, whereas prolactin decreased. This study shows that THC induces both increases and (to a lesser extent) decreases in functional brain connectivity, mainly in brain regions with high densities of CB(1)-receptors. Some of the involved regions could be functionally related to robust THC-induced CNS-effects that have been found in previous studies (Zuurman et al., 2008), such as postural stability, feeling high and altered time perception.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ) antagonists show central side effects, whereas beneficial effects are most likely peripherally mediated. In this study, the peripherally selective CB1 antagonist TM38837 was studied in humans.This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study. On occasions 1-4, 24 healthy subjects received 5 × 4 mg THC with TM38837 100 mg, 500 mg or placebo, or placebos only. During occasion 5, subjects received placebo TM38837 + THC with rimonabant 60 mg or placebo in parallel groups. Blood collections and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects were assessed frequently. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and PD were quantified using population PK-PD modelling.The TM38837 plasma concentration profile was relatively flat compared with rimonabant. TM38837 showed an estimated terminal half-life of 771 h. THC induced effects on VAS feeling high, body sway and heart rate were partly antagonized by rimonabant 60 mg [-26.70\% [90\% confidence interval (CI) -40.9, -12.6\%]; -7.10\%, (90\%CI -18.1, 5.3\%); -7.30\%, (90\% CI -11.5\%, -3.0\%) respectively] and TM38837 500 mg [-22.10\% (90\% CI -34.9, -9.4\%); -12.20\% (90\% CI -21.6\%, -1.7\%); -8.90\% (90\% CI -12.8\%, -5.1\%) respectively]. TM38837 100 mg had no measurable feeling high or body sway effects and limited heart rate effects.Rimonabant showed larger effects than TM38837, but the heart rate effects were similar. TM38837 100 mg had no impact on CNS effects, suggesting that this dose does not penetrate the brain. This TM38837 dose is predicted to be at least equipotent to rimonabant with regard to metabolic disorders in rodent models. These results provide support for further development of TM38837 as a peripherally selective CB1 antagonist for indications such as metabolic disorders, with a reduced propensity for psychiatric side effects.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 ) antagonists have been developed for the treatment of obesity and associated risk factors. Surinabant is a high affinity CB1 antagonist in vitro. The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of inhibition by surinabant of CNS effects and heart rate induced by Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in humans.This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four period six sequence crossover study. Thirty healthy young male occasional cannabis users (<1 per week) were included. A single oral dose of surinabant (5, 20 or 60 mg) or placebo was administered followed 1.5 h later by four intrapulmonary THC doses (2, 4, 6 and 6 mg) or vehicle, administered at 1 h intervals. The wash-out period was 14-21 days. Subjective and objective pharmacodynamic (PD) measurements were performed. A population PK-PD model for THC and surinabant quantified PK and PD effects.Surinabant 20 and 60 mg inhibited all THC-induced PD effects in a similar range for both doses with inhibition ratios ranging from 68.3\% (95\% CI = 32.5, 104.2; heart rate) to 91.1\% (95\% CI = 30.3, 151.8; body sway). IC50 ranged from 22.0 ng ml(-1) [relative standard error (RSE) = 45.2\%; body sway] to 58.8 ng ml(-1) (RSE = 44.2\%; internal perception). Surinabant 5 mg demonstrated no significant effects.The dose-related inhibition by surinabant, without any effect of its own, suggests that this compound behaves as a CB1 receptor antagonist in humans at these concentrations. A single surinabant dose between 5 to 20 mg and above was able to antagonize THC-induced effects in humans.},

  abstract    = {Given the cognitive-promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, the increased prevalence of smoke-inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self-correct cognitive deficits, which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain. As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine's detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) hypofunction plays an important role in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. NMDA-R antagonists elicit psychotic symptoms in humans and schizophrenia-relevant signs in rodents, including a strong increase in cortical gamma activity. NMDA-Rs are composed of different subunits, and accumulating evidence indicates that neuronal damage due to NMDA-R antagonists depends on their action on a specific type of the receptor containing the NR2A subunit. In human schizophrenics, NR2A is selectively reduced in fast-firing interneurons. These neurons are critical for gamma oscillations, indicating that pathological changes in gamma activity may depend on subunit-specific NMDA-R deficit. The present study tested this hypothesis.Cortical electroencephalograms were recorded in freely moving rats and the changes in gamma power were measured after administration of NMDA-R antagonists with different subunit selectivity, including NR2A-preferring (PEAQX, n = 5; NVP-AAM077, n = 18), NR2B-selective (ifenprodil, n = 6; threo-ifenprodil, n = 4; Ro25-6985, n = 13), and NR2C/D-selective (n = 8) antagonists, along with vehicle and nonselective NMDA-R antagonists (ketamine, n = 10; MK801, n = 12). Changes in prepulse inhibition of startle was tested after MK-801 (n = 6), NVP-AAM077, and Ro-6891 (n = 5) injection.Strong increase in gamma power was induced by nonselective NMDA-R antagonists and by blockade of NMDA-Rs containing the NR2A subunit, with co-occurring gating deficits and diminished low-frequency modulation of gamma oscillations. In contrast, selective blockade of NR2B, C, or D subunit-containing receptors had minor effects.Major subtype-specific differences in the role of NMDA-Rs in cortical gamma oscillation may have implications for the pathomechanism and treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.},

AP-evoked Ca2+ transients were detected in both the spines and in the adjacent dendritic shaft, whereas Ca2+ transients evoked by single EPSPs were largely restricted to a single active spine head. Calcium transients elicited in the active spines by a single AP or EPSP, in spines up to 80 micro(m) for the soma, were of comparable amplitude. The Ca2+ transient in an active spine evoked by pairing an EPSP and a back-propagating AP separated by a time interval of 50 ms was larger if the AP followed the EPSP than if it preceded it. This difference reflected supra- and sublinear summation of Ca2+ transients, respectively. A comparable dependence of spinous Ca2+ transients on relative timing was observed also when short bursts of APs and EPSPs were paired. These results indicate that the amplitude of the spinous Ca2+ transients during coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity depended critically on the relative order of subthreshold EPSPs and back-propagating APs. Thus, in neocortical neurons the amplitude of spinous Ca2+ transients could encode small time differences between pre- and postsynaptic activity.},

  abstract    = {Recent data on alterations of the endogenous cannabinoid system in schizophrenia have raised the question of its functional role in this disease. The psychoactive compound of Cannabis sativa, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), has been shown to induce psychotic symptoms, but it is unknown to what extend prodromal states of psychoses are reflected by these experimental approaches. This study compares four groups of subjects: antipsychotic-naïve patients suffering from acute paranoid schizophrenic or schizophreniform psychosis (SZ), patients in the prodromal state (IPS), healthy controls without any pharmacological intervention (HC) and a second group of healthy volunteers who were orally administered synthetic Delta9-THC (Dronabinol) (HC-THC). Neither SZ and IPS nor HC received the experimental drug. All subjects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Binocular Depth Inversion Illusion Test (BDII). The latter represents a sensitive measure of impaired visual information processing that manifests in various experimental and naturally occurring psychotic states. BDII values were well comparable in SZ, IPS and HC-THC, and all groups differed significantly to HC. The BPRS revealed no significant difference between HC-THC and IPS while both were significantly different from SZ and HC, respectively. Our results suggest that Delta9-THC-induced altered states of consciousness may serve as a useful tool for modeling psychotic disorders, particularly their prodromal states. Furthermore, they provide insight into the perceptual and psychopathological alterations induced by Delta9-THC, which is essential for the understanding of the pro-psychotic effects of herbal cannabis preparations with highly enriched Delta9-THC content.},

Synapse formation in early brain development, synapse maintenance, and synaptic plasticity are all influenced by the glutamate system. The number of neurons and the number of their connections are determined by the activity of the glutamate system and its receptors. Malfunctions of the glutamate system affect neuroplasticity and can cause neuronal toxicity. In schizophrenia, many glutamate-regulated processes seem to be perturbed. Abnormal neuronal development, abnormal synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration have been proposed to be causal or contributing factors in schizophrenia. Interestingly, it seems that the glutamate system is dysregulated and that {N-methyl-D-aspartate} receptors operate at reduced activity. Here we discuss how the molecular aspects of glutamate malfunction can explain some of the neuropathology observed in schizophrenia, and how the available treatment intervenes through the glutamate system.},

  abstract    = {Neocortical network activity is generated through a dynamic balance between excitation, provided by pyramidal neurons, and inhibition, provided by interneurons. Imbalance of the excitation/inhibition ratio has been identified in several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism and epilepsy, which also present with other cognitive deficits and symptoms associated with prefrontal cortical (PFC) dysfunction. We undertook a computational approach to study how changes in the excitation/inhibition balance in a PFC microcircuit model affect the properties of persistent activity, considered the cellular correlate of working memory function in PFC. To this end, we constructed a PFC microcircuit, consisting of pyramidal neuron models and all three different interneuron types: fast-spiking (FS), regular-spiking (RS), and irregular-spiking (IS) interneurons. Persistent activity was induced in the microcircuit model with a stimulus to the proximal apical dendrites of the pyramidal neuron models, and its properties were analyzed, such as the induction profile, the interspike intervals (ISIs) and neuronal synchronicity. Our simulations showed that (a) the induction but not the firing frequency or neuronal synchronicity is modulated by changes in the NMDA-to-AMPA ratio on FS interneuron model, (b) removing or decreasing the FS model input to the pyramidal neuron models greatly limited the biophysical modulation of persistent activity induction, decreased the ISIs and neuronal synchronicity during persistent activity, (c) the induction and firing properties could not be altered by the addition of other inhibitory inputs to the soma (from RS or IS models), and (d) the synchronicity change could be reversed by the addition of other inhibitory inputs to the soma, but beyond the levels of the control network. Thus, generic somatic inhibition acts as a pacemaker of persistent activity and FS specific inhibition modulates the output of the pacemaker.},

The beta frequency is able to synchronize over long conduction delays (corresponding to signals traveling a significant distance in the brain) that apparently cannot be tolerated by gamma rhythms.

  abstract    = {Measures of multiple spike train synchrony are essential in order to study issues such as spike timing reliability, network synchronization, and neuronal coding. These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches, the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals (ISIs). In this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward averaged bivariate ISI-distance and the multivariate ISI-diversity based on the coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are parameter-free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarsh-Rose neurons as a controlled configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages of the instantaneous nature of our methods.},

  abstract    = {Recently, the SPIKE-distance has been proposed as a parameter-free and timescale-independent measure of spike train synchrony. This measure is time resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high instantaneous values for eventlike firing patterns. Here we present a substantial improvement of this measure that eliminates this shortcoming. The reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering, i.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains. Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as well as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a causal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train synchrony can be estimated in real time. We demonstrate that these methods are capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally, the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.},

  abstract    = {Techniques for recording large-scale neuronal spiking activity are developing very fast. This leads to an increasing demand for algorithms capable of analyzing large amounts of experimental spike train data. One of the most crucial and demanding tasks is the identification of similarity patterns with a very high temporal resolution and across different spatial scales. To address this task, in recent years three time-resolved measures of spike train synchrony have been proposed, the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance, and event synchronization. The Matlab source codes for calculating and visualizing these measures have been made publicly available. However, due to the many different possible representations of the results the use of these codes is rather complicated and their application requires some basic knowledge of Matlab. Thus it became desirable to provide a more user-friendly and interactive interface. Here we address this need and present SPIKY, a graphical user interface that facilitates the application of time-resolved measures of spike train synchrony to both simulated and real data. SPIKY includes implementations of the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance, and the SPIKE-synchronization (an improved and simplified extension of event synchronization) that have been optimized with respect to computation speed and memory demand. It also comprises a spike train generator and an event detector that makes it capable of analyzing continuous data. Finally, the SPIKY package includes additional complementary programs aimed at the analysis of large numbers of datasets and the estimation of significance levels.},

  abstract    = {Analyzing neural dynamics underlying complex behavior is a major challenge in systems neurobiology. To meet this challenge through computational neuroscience, we have constructed a brain-based device (Darwin X) that interacts with a real environment, and whose behavior is guided by a simulated nervous system incorporating detailed aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the hippocampus and its surrounding regions. Darwin X integrates cues from its environment to solve a spatial memory task. Place-specific units, similar to place cells in the rodent, emerged by integrating visual and self-movement cues during exploration without prior assumptions in the model about environmental inputs. Because synthetic neural modeling using brain-based devices allows recording from all elements of the simulated nervous system during behavior, we were able to identify different functional hippocampal pathways. We did this by tracing back from reference neuronal units in the CA1 region of the simulated hippocampus to all of the synaptically connected units that were coactive during a particular exploratory behavior. Our analysis identified a number of different functional pathways within the simulated hippocampus that incorporate either the perforant path or the trisynaptic loop. Place fields, which were activated by the trisynaptic circuit, tended to be more selective and informative. However, place units that were activated by the perforant path were prevalent in the model and were crucial for generating appropriate exploratory behavior. Thus, in the model, different functional pathways influence place field activity and, hence, behavior during navigation.},

Our analysis identified different functional pathways within the neural simulation and prompts novel predictions about the influence of the perforant path, the trisynaptic loop and hippocampal-cortical interactions on place cell activity and behavior during navigation.

However, even within a single layer, subpopulations of principal cells can often be differentiated by their distinct long-range projection targets. Such subpopulations of principal cells can have different local connection properties and excitatory inputs, forming subnetworks that may serve as separate information-processing channels. Interestingly, as reviewed here, recent evidence has revealed specific instances where interneuron cell types selectively innervated distinct subpopulations of principal cells, targeting only those with particular long-distance projection targets. This organization represents a novel form of interneuron specialization, providing interneurons with the potential to selectively regulate specific information-processing streams.},

  abstract    = {To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor.Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured.Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure.These data indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists produce a broad range of symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of endogenous psychoses, particularly schizophrenia and dissociative states.},

We are reviewing the four major theories, and shall demonstrate, with the use of mathematical models of attention and memory, that only one theory is capable of reconciling all of them by explaining the basic effects of each theory in a unified fashion, without altogether sacrificing their individual contributions. The key issue here is whether or not a memory trace is ever stored in the hippocampus itself, and there is no reconciliation unless the answer to that question is that there is not. As a result of the reconciliation that we are proposing, there is a simple solution to several outstanding problems concerning the neurobiology of memory such as: consolidation and reconsolidation, persistency of long term memory, novelty detection, habituation, long-term potentiation, and the multifrequency oscillatory self-organization of the brain.},

To better clarify GABAergic neuron diversity, we assessed the colocalization of these 6 chemical markers with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y (NPY), the substance P receptor (SPR), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS); these 4 additional chemical markers suggested to be expressed diversely or specifically among cortical GABA cells. We further correlated morphological and physiological characteristics of identified some chemical subclasses of inhibitory neurons. Our results reveal expression specificity of CRF, NPY, SPR, and NOS in morphologically and physiologically distinct interneuron classes.

  abstract    = {Cannabis use is associated with psychosis, particularly in those with expression of, or vulnerability for, psychotic illness. The biological underpinnings of these differential associations, however, remain largely unknown. We used Positron Emission Tomography and (18)F-fallypride to test the hypothesis that genetic risk for psychosis is expressed by differential induction of dopamine release by Δ(9)-THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis). In a single dynamic PET scanning session, striatal dopamine release after pulmonary administration of Δ(9)-THC was measured in 9 healthy cannabis users (average risk psychotic disorder), 8 patients with psychotic disorder (high risk psychotic disorder) and 7 un-related first-degree relatives (intermediate risk psychotic disorder). PET data were analyzed applying the linear extension of the simplified reference region model (LSRRM), which accounts for time-dependent changes in (18)F-fallypride displacement. Voxel-based statistical maps, representing specific D2/3 binding changes, were computed to localize areas with increased ligand displacement after Δ(9)-THC administration, reflecting dopamine release. While Δ(9)-THC was not associated with dopamine release in the control group, significant ligand displacement induced by Δ(9)-THC in striatal subregions, indicative of dopamine release, was detected in both patients and relatives. This was most pronounced in caudate nucleus. This is the first study to demonstrate differential sensitivity to Δ(9)-THC in terms of increased endogenous dopamine release in individuals at risk for psychosis.},

  abstract    = {The hippocampus has contributed enormously to our understanding of the operation of elemental brain circuits, not least through the classification of forebrain interneurons. Understanding the operation of interneuron networks however requires not only a wiring diagram that describes the innervation and postsynaptic targets of different GABAergic cells, but also an appreciation of the temporal dimension. Interneurons differ extensively in their intrinsic firing rates, their recruitment in different brain rhythms, and in their synaptic kinetics. Furthermore, in common with principal neurons, both the synapses innervating interneurons and the synapses made by these cells are highly modifiable, reflecting both their recent or remote use (short-term and long-term plasticity) and the action of extracellular messengers.

  abstract   = {In the mammalian brain most excitatory transmission is mediated by glutamate binding to {AMPA} and {NMDA} receptors. These receptors have markedly different biophysical properties, and at synapses in the {CAI} region of the hippocampus they play complementary roles in long-term potentiation {(LTP):} while postsynaptic {NMDA} receptor activation is necessary for the induction of this form of plasticity, {AMPA} receptors play a larger role in its expression. Recent studies in hippocampal slices have revealed a further striking difference in the behaviour of the two receptor types: {NMDA} receptors consistently sense a larger number of quanta of glutamate released from presynaptic terminals than do {AMPA} receptors. Two alternative explanations for this are either that {AMPA} receptors are functionally silent at a proportion of synapses (although they can be uncovered by {LTP)}, or that glutamate can spill over from neighbouring synapses and selectively activate {NMDA} (but not {AMPA)} receptors. Both of these competing hypotheses have extensive implications for the mechanisms of expression of {LTP.} Extrasynaptic glutamate diffusion appears to depend critically on the recording temperature, but if excitatory synapses are sufficiently close for cross-talk to occur under physiological conditions, it could have profound implications for the specificity of synaptic communication in the brain.},

  abstract  = {Following exocytosis at excitatory synapses in the brain, glutamate binds to several subtypes of postsynaptic receptors. The degree of occupancy of {AMPA} and {NMDA} receptors at hippocampal synapses is, however, not known. One approach to estimate receptor occupancy is to examine quantal amplitude fluctuations of postsynaptic signals in hippocampal neurons studied in vitro. The results of such experiments suggest that {NMDA} receptors at {CA1} synapses are activated not only by glutamate released from the immediately apposed presynaptic terminals, but also by glutamate spillover from neighbouring terminals. Numerical simulations point to the extracellular diffusion coefficient as a critical parameter that determines the extent of activation of receptors positioned at different distances from the release site. We have shown that raising the viscosity of the extracellular medium can modulate the diffusion coefficient, providing an experimental tool to investigate the role of diffusion in activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Whether intersynaptic cross-talk mediated by {NMDA} receptors occurs in vivo remains to be determined. The theoretical and experimental approaches described here also promise to shed light on the roles of metabotropic and kainate receptors, which often occur in an extrasynaptic distribution, and are therefore positioned to sense glutamate escaping from the synaptic cleft.},

Computational models emphasize the potential role of the hippocampus in novelty detection, its unique anatomical circuitry making it ideally suited to act as a comparator between past and present experience. The hippocampus, therefore, is viewed to detect associative mismatches between what is expected based on retrieval of past experience and current sensory input. However, direct evidence that the human hippocampus performs such operations is lacking. We explored brain responses to novel sequences of objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while subjects performed an incidental target detection task. Our results demonstrate that hippocampal activation was maximal when prior predictions concerning which object would appear next in a sequence were violated by sensory reality. In so doing, we establish the biological reality of associative match-mismatch computations within the human hippocampus, a process widely held to play a cardinal role in novelty detection. Our results also suggest that the hippocampus may generate predictions about how future events will unfold, and critically detect when these expectancies are violated, even when task demands do not require it. The present study also offers broader insights into the nature of essential computations carried out by the hippocampus, which may also underpin its unique contribution to episodic memory.},

  abstract    = {The hippocampus has long been proposed to play a critical role in novelty detection through its ability to act as a comparator between past and present experience. A recent study provided evidence for this hypothesis by characterizing hippocampal responses to sequence novelty, a type of associative novelty where familiar items appear in a new temporal order. Here, we ask whether a hippocampal match-mismatch (i.e., comparator) mechanism operates selectively to identify the violation of predictions within the temporal domain or instead also underlies the processing of associative novelty in other domains (e.g., spatial). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a repetition paradigm in which subjects viewed sequences of objects presented in distinct locations on the screen and performed an incidental target detection task. The left hippocampus exhibited a pattern of activity consistent with that of an associative match-mismatch detector, with novelty signals generated only in conditions where one contextual component was novel and the other repeated. In contrast, right hippocampal activation signaled the presence of objects in familiar locations. Our results suggest that hippocampal match-mismatch computations constitute a general mechanism underpinning the processing of associative novelty. These findings support a model in which hippocampal mismatch signals rely critically on the recall of previous experience, a process that only occurs when novel sensory inputs overlap significantly with stored representations. More generally, the current study also offers insights into how the hippocampus automatically represents the spatiotemporal context of our experiences, a function that may relate to its role in episodic memory.},

Empirical evidence and computational work have provided biologically plausible models of the neural substrate and mechanisms underlying the coding of stimulus novelty in the perirhinal cortex. In this article, we highlight the importance of a different category of novelty, namely associative novelty, which has received relatively little attention, despite its clear ecological importance. While previous studies in both animals and humans have documented hippocampal responses in relation to associative novelty, a key issue concerning the computations underlying these novelty signals has not been previously addressed. We argue that this question has importance not only for our understanding of novelty processing, but also for advancing our knowledge of the fundamental computational operations performed by the hippocampus. We suggest a different approach to this problem, and discuss recent evidence supporting the hypothesis that the hippocampus operates as a comparator during the processing of associative novelty, generating mismatch/novelty signals when prior predictions are violated by sensory reality. We also draw on conceptual similarities between associative novelty and contextual novelty to suggest that empirical findings from these two seemingly distant research fields accord with the operation of a comparator mechanism during novelty detection more generally. We therefore conclude that a comparator mechanism may underlie the role of the hippocampus not only in detecting occurrences that are unexpected given specific associatively retrieved predictions, but also events that violate more abstract properties of the experimental context.},

  abstract    = {The knowledge that excitatory synapses on aspiny hippocampal interneurons can develop genuine forms of activity-dependent remodeling, independently from the surrounding network of principal cells, is a relatively new concept. Cumulative evidence has now unequivocally demonstrated that, despite the absence of specialized postsynaptic spines that serve as compartmentalized structure for intracellular signaling in principal cell plasticity, excitatory inputs onto interneurons can undergo forms of synaptic plasticity that are induced and expressed autonomously from principal cells. Yet, the rules for induction and expression of interneuron plasticity are much more heterogeneous than in principal neurons. Long-term plasticity in interneurons is not necessarily dependent upon postsynaptic activation of NMDA receptors nor relies on the same postsynaptic membrane potential requirements as principal cells. Plasticity in interneurons rather requires activation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and/or metabotropic glutamate receptors and is triggered by postsynaptic hyperpolarization. In this review we will outline these distinct features of interneuron plasticity and identify potential critical candidate molecules that might be important for sustaining long-lasting changes in synaptic strength at excitatory inputs onto interneurons.

The regulation of GABA(B) eIPSPs or the interneurons that produce them are not well understood. In addition, while both micro-opioid receptors (microORs) and cannabinoid CB1R receptors (CB1Rs) are present on hippocampal interneurons, it is not clear how these two systems interact.This study tests the hypotheses that: (1) all interneurons can initiate both GABA(A) and GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials; (2) GABA(B) responses are insensitive to mGluR-triggered, endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated inhibitory long-term depression (iLTD); (3) GABA(B) responses are produced by interneurons that express microOR; and (4) CB1R-dependent and microOR-dependent response interact.Pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches were used in acute rat hippocampal slices. High resistance microelectrode recordings were made from pyramidal cells, while interneurons were stimulated extracellularly.GABA(B) responses were found to be produced by interneurons that release GABA via either presynaptic N-type or P/Q-type calcium channels but that they are insensitive to suppression by eCBs or eCB-mediated iLTD. GABA(B) IPSPs were sensitive to suppression by a microOR agonist, suggesting a major source of GABA(B) responses is the microOR-expressing interneuron population. A small eCB-iLTD (10\% eIPSP reduction) persisted in conotoxin. eCB-iLTD was blocked by a microOR agonist in 6/13 slices.GABA(B) responses cannot be produced by all interneurons. CB1R or microOR agonists will differentially alter the balance of activity in hippocampal circuits. CB1R- and microOR-mediated responses can interact.},

However, despite decades of clinical and scientific investigation, there is no unifying theory of EEG organization, and the role of ongoing activity in sensory processing remains controversial. This study analyzed laminar profiles of synaptic activity [current source density CSD] and multiunit activity (MUA), both spontaneous and stimulus-driven, in primary auditory cortex of awake macaque monkeys. Our results reveal that the EEG is hierarchically organized; delta (1-4 Hz) phase modulates theta (4-10 Hz) amplitude, and theta phase modulates gamma (30-50 Hz) amplitude. This oscillatory hierarchy controls baseline excitability and thus stimulus-related responses in a neuronal ensemble. We propose that the hierarchical organization of ambient oscillatory activity allows auditory cortex to structure its temporal activity pattern so as to optimize the processing of rhythmic inputs.},

  abstract    = {Tuft dendrites are the main target for feedback inputs innervating neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons, but their properties remain obscure. We report the existence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spikes in the fine distal tuft dendrites that otherwise did not support the initiation of calcium spikes. Both direct measurements and computer simulations showed that NMDA spikes are the dominant mechanism by which distal synaptic input leads to firing of the neuron and provide the substrate for complex parallel processing of top-down input arriving at the tuft. These data lead to a new unifying view of integration in pyramidal neurons in which all fine dendrites, basal and tuft, integrate inputs locally through the recruitment of NMDA receptor channels relative to the fixed apical calcium and axosomatic sodium integration points.},

  abstract    = {This review covers the spatial and temporal rules governing induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) by theta-burst stimulation. Induction of LTP in field CA1 by high frequency stimulation bursts that resemble the burst discharges (complex-spikes) of hippocampal pyramidal neurons involves a multiple-step mechanism. A single burst is insufficient for LTP induction because it evokes both excitatory and inhibitory currents that partially cancel and limit postsynaptic depolarization. Bursts repeated at the frequency (~5 Hz) of the endogenous theta rhythm induce maximal LTP, primarily because this frequency disables feed-forward inhibition and allows sufficient postsynaptic depolarization to activate voltage-sensitive NMDA receptors. The disinhibitory process, referred to as "priming", involves presynaptic GABA autoreceptors that inhibit GABA release. Activation of NMDA receptors allows a calcium flux into dendritic spines that serves as the proximal trigger for LTP. We include new data showing that theta-burst stimulation is more efficient than other forms of stimulation for LTP induction. In addition, we demonstrate that associative interactions between synapses activated during theta-bursts are limited to major dendritic domains since such interactions occur within apical or basal dendritic trees but not between them. We review evidence that recordings of electrophysiological responses during theta burst stimulation can help to determine if experimental manipulations that affect LTP do so by affecting events antecedent to the induction process, such as NMDA receptor activation, or downstream signaling cascades that result from postsynaptic calcium fluxes. Finally, we argue that theta-burst LTP represents a minimal model for stable, non-decremental LTP that is more sensitive to a variety of experimental manipulations than is LTP induced by other stimulation paradigms. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI: Brain and Memory.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal oscillations reflect coordinated neuronal activity on many timescales. Distinct types of GABAergic interneuron participate in the coordination of pyramidal cells over different oscillatory cycle phases. In the CA3 area, which generates sharp waves and gamma oscillations, the contribution of identified GABAergic neurons remains to be defined. We have examined the firing of a family of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons during network oscillations in urethane-anesthetized rats and compared them with firing of CA3 pyramidal cells. The position of the terminals of individual visualized interneurons was highly diverse, selective, and often spatially coaligned with either the entorhinal or the associational inputs to area CA3. The spike timing in relation to theta and gamma oscillations and sharp waves was correlated with the innervated pyramidal cell domain. Basket and dendritic-layer-innervating interneurons receive entorhinal and associational inputs and preferentially fire on the ascending theta phase, when pyramidal cell assemblies emerge. Perforant-path-associated cells, driven by recurrent collaterals of pyramidal cells fire on theta troughs, when established pyramidal cell assemblies are most active. In the CA3 area, slow and fast gamma oscillations occurred on opposite theta oscillation phases. Perforant-path-associated and some COUP-TFII-positive interneurons are strongly coupled to both fast and slow gamma oscillations, but basket and dendritic-layer-innervating cells are weakly coupled to fast gamma oscillations only. During sharp waves, different interneuron types are activated, inhibited, or remain unaffected. We suggest that specialization in pyramidal cell domain and glutamatergic input-specific operations, reflected in the position of GABAergic terminals, is the evolutionary drive underlying the diversity of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons.},

  abstract   = {{NMDA} receptors require both L-glutamate and the coagonist glycine for efficient channel activation. The glycine binding site of these heteromeric receptor proteins is formed by regions of the {NMDAR1} {(NR1)} subunit that display sequence similarity to bacterial amino acid binding proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the glutamate binding site is located on the homologous regions of the {NR2B} subunit. Mutation of residues within the N-terminal domain and the loop region between membrane segments M3 and M4 significantly reduced the efficacy of glutamate, but not glycine, in channel gating. Some of the mutations also decreased inhibition by the glutamate antagonists, {D-AP5} and {R-CPP.} Homology-based molecular modeling of the glutamate and glycine binding domains indicates that the {NR2} and {NR1} subunits use similar residues to ligate the agonists' alpha-aminocarboxylic acid groups, whereas differences in side chain interactions and size of aromatic residues determine ligand selectivity.},

  abstract    = {Semantic priming between items stored and associated in memory underlies contextual recall. Response times to process a given target item are shorter when following presentation of a related prime item than when it is unrelated. The study of priming effects allows investigating the structure of semantic networks as a function of association strength and number of links relating the prime and target. Behavioral data from divided visual field experiments in healthy subjects show a variability in the magnitude of priming effects when the left or right hemisphere is primary involved. Data from schizophrenic patients also exhibit variability in priming magnitude compared to data from healthy subjects. Mathematical models of cortical networks allow theorists to understand the link between the physiology of single neurons and synapses and network behavior. Computational modelling can replicate electrophysiological recordings of cortical neurons in monkeys, that exhibit two types of task-related activity, 'retrospective' (related to a previously shown stimulus) and 'prospective' (related to a stimulus expected to appear, due to learned association between both stimuli). Experimental studies of associative priming report priming effects on behavioral data in both human and monkeys. Cortical network models can account for a large variety of priming effects observed in human, and for the dependence of retrospective activity on dopamine neuromodulation. Here, we investigate how variable levels of dopamine in a model of a cortical network can modulate prospective activity to vary the magnitude of semantic priming. We simulate a biologically realistic network of integrate and fire neurons to study the effects of dopaminergic neuromodulation of NMDA receptors of glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons on semantic priming dynamics. Results support the possibility that different levels of dopaminergic neuromodulation can subtend hemispheric differences in semantic priming, corresponding to focused priming in the left hemisphere and to extended priming in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, results can account for priming perturbations in schizophrenia depending on the level of dopamine.},

We used rapid ligand application (100-micros solution exchange) to examine the effects of alpha-subunit composition on GABA-evoked activation and deactivation rates. HEK 293 cells were transfected with human cDNAs encoding alpha1beta1gamma2- or alpha2beta1gamma2-subunits. Channel kinetics were similar across different transfections of the same subunits and reproducible across several GABA applications in the same patch. Current rise to peak was at least twice as fast for alpha2beta1gamma2 receptors than for alpha1beta1gamma2 receptors (reflected in 10-90\% rise times of 0.5 versus 1.0 ms, respectively), and deactivation was six to seven times slower (long time constants of 208 ms versus 31 ms) after saturating GABA applications. Thus alpha-subunit composition determined activation and deactivation kinetics of GABA(A) receptor channels and is therefore likely to influence the kinetics and efficacy of inhibitory postsynaptic currents.},

  abstract    = {The M-current (I(M)), comprised of Kv7 channels, is a voltage-activated K+ conductance that plays a key role in the control of cell excitability. In hippocampal principal cells, I(M) controls action potential (AP) accommodation and contributes to the medium-duration afterhyperpolarization, but the role of I(M) in control of interneuron excitability remains unclear. Here, we investigated I(M) in hippocampal stratum oriens (SO) interneurons, both from wild-type and transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) was expressed in somatostatin-containing interneurons. Somatodendritic expression of Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 subunits was colocalized in a subset of GFP+ SO interneurons, corresponding to oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) cells. Under voltage clamp (VC) conditions at -30 mV, the Kv7 channel antagonists linopirdine/XE-991 abolished the I(M) amplitude present during relaxation from -30 to -50 mV and reduced the holding current (I(hold)). In addition, 0.5 mM tetraethylammonium reduced I(M), suggesting that I(M) was composed of Kv7.2-containing channels. In contrast, the Kv7 channel opener retigabine increased I(M) amplitude and I(hold). When strongly depolarized in VC, the linopirdine-sensitive outward current activated rapidly and comprised up to 20\% of the total current. In current-clamp recordings from GFP+ SO cells, linopirdine induced depolarization and increased AP frequency, whereas retigabine induced hyperpolarization and arrested firing. In multicompartment O-LM interneuron models that incorporated I(M), somatodendritic placement of Kv7 channels best reproduced experimentally measured I(M). The models suggest that Kv3- and Kv7-mediated channels both rapidly activate during single APs; however, Kv3 channels control rapid repolarization of the AP, whereas Kv7 channels primarily control the interspike interval.},

In EEG studies, ketamine affects sensory gating and alters the oscillatory characteristics of neuronal signals in a complex manner. We investigated the effects of ketamine on in vivo recordings from the CA3 region of mouse hippocampus referenced to the ipsilateral frontal sinus using a paired-click auditory gating paradigm. One issue of particular interest was elucidating the effect of ketamine on background network activity, poststimulus evoked and induced activity. We find that ketamine attenuates the theta frequency band in both background activity and in poststimulus evoked activity. Ketamine also disrupts a late, poststimulus theta power reduction seen in control recordings. In the gamma frequency range, ketamine enhances both background and evoked power, but decreases relative induced power. These findings support a role for NMDA receptors in mediating the balance between theta and gamma responses to sensory stimuli, with possible implications for dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

Synapses between pairs of pyramidal cells involve one or few release sites and are weaker than connections made by mossy fibers on CA3 pyramidal cells. Synapses with interneurons are rather effective, as needed to control unchecked excitation. We examine contributions of recurrent synapses to epileptiform synchrony, to the genesis of sharp waves in the CA3 region and to population oscillations at theta and gamma frequencies. Recurrent connections in CA3, as other associative cortices, have a lower connectivity spread over a larger area than in primary sensory cortices. This sparse, but wide-ranging connectivity serves the functions of an associative network, including acquisition of neuronal representations as activity in groups of CA3 cells and completion involving the recall from partial cues of these ensemble firing patterns.},

  abstract    = {The quantification of phase synchrony between neuronal signals is of crucial importance for the study of large-scale interactions in the brain. Two methods have been used to date in neuroscience, based on two distinct approaches which permit a direct estimation of the instantaneous phase of a signal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 3291; Human Brain Mapping 8 (1999) 194]. The phase is either estimated by using the analytic concept of Hilbert transform or, alternatively, by convolution with a complex wavelet. In both methods the stability of the instantaneous phase over a window of time requires quantification by means of various statistical dependence parameters (standard deviation, Shannon entropy or mutual information). The purpose of this paper is to conduct a direct comparison between these two methods on three signal sets: (1) neural models; (2) intracranial signals from epileptic patients; and (3) scalp EEG recordings. Levels of synchrony that can be considered as reliable are estimated by using the technique of surrogate data. Our results demonstrate that the differences between the methods are minor, and we conclude that they are fundamentally equivalent for the study of neuroelectrical signals. This offers a common language and framework that can be used for future research in the area of synchronization.},

  abstract    = {Emotional arousal, mediated by the amygdala, is known to modulate episodic memories stored by the hippocampus, a region involved in pattern separation (the process by which similar representations are independently stored). While emotional modulation and pattern separation have been examined independently, this study attempts to link the two areas of research to propose an alternative account for how emotion modulates episodic memory. We used an emotional discrimination task designed to tax pattern separation of emotional information by concurrently varying emotional valence and similarity of stimuli. To examine emotional modulation of memory at the level of hippocampal subfields, we used high-resolution fMRI (1.5 mm isotropic) of the medial temporal lobe. Consistent with prior reports, we observed engagement of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 during accurate discrimination of highly similar items (behavioral correlate of pattern separation). Furthermore, we observed an emotional modulation of this signal (negative > neutral) specific to trials on which participants accurately discriminated similar emotional items. The amygdala was also modulated by emotion, regardless of the accuracy of discrimination. Additionally, we found aberrant amygdala-hippocampal network activity in a sample of adults with depressive symptoms. In this sample, amygdala activation was enhanced and DG/CA3 activation was diminished during emotional discrimination compared to those without depressive symptoms. Depressive symptom severity was also negatively correlated with DG/CA3 activity. This study suggests a novel mechanistic account for how emotional information is processed by hippocampal subfields as well as how this network may be altered in mood disorders.},

  abstract    = {Cognitive symptoms are core features of mental disorders but procognitive treatments are limited. We have proposed a "discoordination" hypothesis that cognitive impairment results from aberrant coordination of neural activity. We reported that neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion (NVHL) rats, an established neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, have abnormal neural synchrony and cognitive deficits in the active place avoidance task. During stillness, we observed that cortical local field potentials sometimes resembled epileptiform spike-wave discharges with higher prevalence in NVHL rats, indicating abnormal neural synchrony due perhaps to imbalanced excitation-inhibition coupling. Here, within the context of the hypothesis, we investigated whether attenuating abnormal neural synchrony will improve cognition in NVHL rats. We report that: (1) inter-hippocampal synchrony in the theta and beta bands is correlated with active place avoidance performance; (2) the anticonvulsant ethosuximide attenuated the abnormal spike-wave activity, improved cognitive control, and reduced hyperlocomotion; (3) ethosuximide not only normalized the task-associated theta and beta synchrony between the two hippocampi but also increased synchrony between the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus above control levels; (4) the antipsychotic olanzapine was less effective at improving cognitive control and normalizing place avoidance-related inter-hippocampal neural synchrony, although it reduced hyperactivity; and (5) olanzapine caused an abnormal pattern of frequency-independent increases in neural synchrony, in both NVHL and control rats. These data suggest that normalizing aberrant neural synchrony can be beneficial and that drugs targeting the pathophysiology of abnormally coordinated neural activities may be a promising theoretical framework and strategy for developing treatments that improve cognition in neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) fast-spiking basket cells are thought to play key roles in network functions related to precise time keeping during behaviorally relevant hippocampal synchronous oscillations. Although they express relatively few receptors for neuromodulators, the highly abundant and functionally important neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is able to selectively depolarize PV+ basket cells, making these cells sensitive biosensors for CCK. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the CCK-induced selective and powerful excitation of PV+ basket cells are not understood. We used single and paired patch-clamp recordings in acute rat hippocampal slices, in combination with post hoc identification of the recorded interneurons, to demonstrate that CCK acts via G-protein-coupled CCK2 receptors to engage sharply divergent intracellular pathways to exert its cell-type-selective effects. In contrast to CCK2 receptors on pyramidal cells that signal through the canonical G(q)-PLC pathway to trigger endocannabinoid-mediated signaling events, CCK2 receptors on neighboring PV+ basket cells couple to an unusual, pertussis-toxin-sensitive pathway. The latter pathway involves ryanodine receptors on intracellular calcium stores that ultimately activate a nonselective cationic conductance to depolarize PV+ basket cells. CCK has highly cell-type-selective effects even within the PV+ cell population, as the PV+ dendrite-targeting bistratified cells do not respond to CCK. Together, these results demonstrate that an abundant ligand such as CCK can signal through the same receptor in different neurons to use cell-type-selective signaling pathways to provide divergence and specificity to its effects.},

However, CB(1)R and CCK-positive GABAergic terminals are present on pyramidal cell dendrites as well, but the principles of endocannabinoid control of GABA release in dendrites are not understood. We performed paired recordings from CCK-positive perisomatically (basket cells) or dendritically projecting (Schaffer collateral-associated cells) interneurons and postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells to determine the properties of endocannabinoid signaling at GABAergic synapses along the somato-dendritic axis. Although several key elements of the currently known molecular machinery for endocannabinoid synthesis are thought be primarily localized in dendrites, our results revealed that the depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, the endocannabinoid-mediated tonic inhibition of GABA release, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor activation-induced, CB(1)R-mediated depression of GABA release were all significantly less effective at dendritic compared with perisomatic synapses. In addition, low concentration of exogenous CB(1) receptor agonist inhibited GABA release to a lesser extent at dendritic compared with perisomatic synapses, indicating that presynaptic differences are partly responsible for the differential control of GABA release by endocannabinoids in dendrites. Together, these data demonstrate a novel domain-specific regulation of GABA release by endocannabinoid signaling in the hippocampus.},

  abstract    = {Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an abundant neuropeptide involved in normal behaviour and pathophysiological conditions. Recently, CCK was shown to act as a molecular switch for perisomatic inhibition in the hippocampus, by directly depolarizing parvalbumin expressing (PV+) basket cells while indirectly depressing GABA release from CCK expressing (CCK+) basket cells. However, whether these two CCK-mediated effects are causally related is controversial, with one hypothesis proposing that the CCK-induced firing of PV+ basket cells increases the release of GABA, which, in turn, heterosynaptically inhibits GABA release from neighbouring CCK+ basket cell terminals through presynaptic GABAB receptors. Our present data from paired recording experiments from presynaptic basket cells and postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells in acute rat brain slices show that the P/Q Ca2+ channel antagonist agatoxin TK (250 nm) abolished GABA release from PV+ basket cells, but it had no effect on the CCK-induced depression of GABA release from CCK+ basket cells. Furthermore, CCK decreased GABA release from CCK+ basket cells even in the presence of the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845 (2 μm). In contrast, cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor blockade with AM251 (10 μm) prevented the action of CCK on GABA release both from CCK+ basket cells and dendritically projecting, CCK+ Schaffer collateral-associated interneurons. These results demonstrate that CCK-mediated inhibition of GABA release from CCK+ cells requires no cross-talk between PV+ and CCK+ synapses, but that it critically depends on CB1 receptor-mediated endocannabinoid signalling at both perisomatic and dendritic inputs.},

  abstract    = {It has long been recognized that generalized deficits in cognitive ability represent a core component of schizophrenia (SCZ), evident before full illness onset and independent of medication. The possibility of genetic overlap between risk for SCZ and cognitive phenotypes has been suggested by the presence of cognitive deficits in first-degree relatives of patients with SCZ; however, until recently, molecular genetic approaches to test this overlap have been lacking. Within the last few years, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SCZ have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of the heritability of the disorder is explained by a polygenic component consisting of many common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of extremely small effect. Similar results have been reported in GWAS of general cognitive ability. The primary aim of the present study is to provide the first molecular genetic test of the classic endophenotype hypothesis, which states that alleles associated with reduced cognitive ability should also serve to increase risk for SCZ. We tested the endophenotype hypothesis by applying polygenic SNP scores derived from a large-scale cognitive GWAS meta-analysis (~5000 individuals from nine nonclinical cohorts comprising the Cognitive Genomics consorTium (COGENT)) to four SCZ case-control cohorts. As predicted, cases had significantly lower cognitive polygenic scores compared to controls. In parallel, polygenic risk scores for SCZ were associated with lower general cognitive ability. In addition, using our large cognitive meta-analytic data set, we identified nominally significant cognitive associations for several SNPs that have previously been robustly associated with SCZ susceptibility. Results provide molecular confirmation of the genetic overlap between SCZ and general cognitive ability, and may provide additional insight into pathophysiology of the disorder.},

  abstract    = {Although schizophrenia is an illness that has been historically characterized by the presence of positive symptomatology, decades of research highlight the importance of cognitive deficits in this disorder. This review proposes that the theoretical model of cognitive control, which is based on contemporary cognitive neuroscience, provides a unifying theory for the cognitive and neural abnormalities underlying higher cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. To support this model, we outline converging evidence from multiple modalities (eg, structural and functional neuroimaging, pharmacological data, and animal models) and samples (eg, clinical high risk, genetic high risk, first episode, and chronic subjects) to emphasize how dysfunction in cognitive control mechanisms supported by the prefrontal cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of higher cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Our model provides a theoretical link between cellular abnormalities (eg, reductions in dentritic spines, interneuronal dysfunction), functional disturbances in local circuit function (eg, gamma abnormalities), altered inter-regional cortical connectivity, a range of higher cognitive deficits, and symptom presentation (eg, disorganization) in the disorder. Finally, we discuss recent advances in the neuropharmacology of cognition and how they can inform a targeted approach to the development of effective therapies for this disabling aspect of schizophrenia.},

  abstract  = {The interactions between the glycine and glutamate binding sites of the {NMDA} receptor have been studied in outside-out patches and synapses from hippocampal neurons in culture using rapid drug application techniques. Desensitization of {NMDA} receptor-mediated currents elicited by glutamate in newly excised outside-out patches was reduced in the presence of saturating concentrations of glycine. This suggests that the glutamate and glycine binding sites of the {NMDA} receptor are allosterically coupled as has been reported in whole-cell preparations. A glycine-insensitive form of desensitization increased rapidly over the first few minutes of recording and largely occluded the glycine concentration-sensitive desensitization in outside-out patches. However, even in old patches that displayed no glycine-sensitive desensitization, the unbinding rate of glycine was increased fourfold by the presence of glutamate, suggesting that the two binding sites were still allosterically coupled. These data suggest the existence of two forms of {NMDA} receptor desensitization in outside-out patches, only one of which is dependent on the concentration of glycine. In the presence of saturating levels of glycine, activation of {NMDA} receptors by synaptic stimulation or by exogenous glutamate resulted in currents that relaxed biexponentially. Addition of the partial glycine-site agonist 1-hydroxy-3-aminopyrrolid-2-one {(HA-966)} increased the rate of decay of both synaptic and patch currents. This suggests that {HA-966} increases the dissociation rate of glutamate from {NMDA} receptors. These results support the hypothesis that the glutamate and glycine binding sites of {NMDA} receptors interact allosterically; ligand binding at both types of sites can affect the affinity of the other type for its agonist.},

  abstract  = {The present study deals with the functional interaction of antipsychotic drugs and {NMDA} receptors. We show that both the conventional antipsychotic drug haloperidol and the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine mediate gene expression via intracellular regulation of {NMDA} receptors, albeit to different extents. Data obtained in primary striatal culture demonstrate that the intraneuronal signal transduction pathway activated by haloperidol, the {cAMP} pathway, leads to phosphorylation of the {NR1} subtype of the {NMDA} receptor at {(897)Ser.} Haloperidol treatment is likewise shown to increase {(897)Ser-NR1} phosphorylation in rats in vivo. Mutation of {(896)Ser} and {(897)Ser} to alanine, which prevents phosphorylation at both sites, inhibits {cAMP-mediated} gene expression. We conclude that antipsychotic drugs have the ability to modulate {NMDA} receptor function by an intraneuronal signal transduction mechanism. This facilitation of {NMDA} activity is necessary for antipsychotic drug-mediated gene expression and may contribute to the therapeutic benefits as well as side effects of antipsychotic drug treatment.},

We investigated theta phase of firing in principal cells in subiculum and CA1 as rats foraged in familiar and novel environments. We found that the preferred theta phase of firing in CA1, but not subiculum, was shifted to a later phase of the theta cycle during environmental novelty. Furthermore, the amount of phase shift elicited by environmental change correlated with the extent of place cell remapping in CA1. Our results support a relationship between theta phase and novelty-induced plasticity in CA1.},

  abstract    = {To derive a biologically based theory of comorbidity in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Theoretical concepts and empirical studies were reviewed to determine whether the behavioral inhibition concept provided an understanding of biological processes involved in comorbidity in ADHD. Empirical studies of ADHD have shown comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety, while studies of behavioral inhibition tend to suggest independent disruptive and anxiety traits. This paradox can be resolved by an understanding of the dynamics of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) systems, where reward and delay of reinforcement are determined by tonic/phasic DA relationships, resulting in impulsive 'fearless' responses when impaired. On the other hand, comorbid anxiety is related to impaired synaptic processes, which selectively gate fear (or aggressive) responses from the amygdala at the accumbens. Monosynaptic convergence between prefrontal, hippocampal, and amygdala projection neurons at the accumbens allows the operation of a synaptic gating mechanism between prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Impairment of this mechanism by lowered PFC inhibition allows greater amygdala input, and anxiety-related processes more impact, over the accumbens. In conclusion, a dual theory incorporating long-term tonic/phasic mesolimbic DA relationships and secondly impairment of PFC and hippocampal inputs to synaptic gating of anxiety at the accumbens has implications for comorbidity in ADHD, as well as for possible pharmacological interventions, utilizing either stimulant or axiolytic interventions. The use of DA partial agonists may also be of interest.},

We previously reported that an elevation of anandamide levels in cerebrospinal fluid inversely correlated to psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, enhanced anandamide signaling let to a lower transition rate from initial prodromal states into frank psychosis as well as postponed transition. In our translational approach, we performed a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of cannabidiol vs amisulpride, a potent antipsychotic, in acute schizophrenia to evaluate the clinical relevance of our initial findings. Either treatment was safe and led to significant clinical improvement, but cannabidiol displayed a markedly superior side-effect profile. Moreover, cannabidiol treatment was accompanied by a significant increase in serum anandamide levels, which was significantly associated with clinical improvement. The results suggest that inhibition of anandamide deactivation may contribute to the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol potentially representing a completely new mechanism in the treatment of schizophrenia.},

Using this model the effects of nabilone, a psychoactive synthetic 9-trans-ketocannabinoid, and of cannabidiol, the main natural component of herbal cannabis, and a combined application of both substances on binocular depth inversion and behavioural states were investigated in nine healthy male volunteers. The time course of the effects of both substances on binocular depth inversion was analysed after oral administration using three different groups of natural stimuli. A significant impairment of binocular depth perception was found when nabilone was administered, but combined application with cannabidiol revealed somewhat reduced effects on binocular depth inversion. The influence of psychoactive cannabinoids on this perceptual model and the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in visual information processing are discussed.},

The effects of THC were confined to the positive words, for which an enhancement of the positivity to the old words was seen. This effect was interpreted in terms of a congruity of the drug-induced mood state and the material to be recognized.

For example, immunoreactivity for the GABA membrane transporter (GAT1) is decreased in presynaptic chandelier neuron axon terminals, whereas immunoreactivity for the GABA(A) receptor α2 subunit is increased in postsynaptic AIS. These alterations are most marked in cortical layers 2-3. In addition, other determinants of the function of chandelier cell-pyramidal neuron synapses, such as ankyrin-G (which regulates the recruitment of sodium channels to the AIS), are also selectively altered in superficial layer pyramidal neurons in subjects with schizophrenia. Each of these components of chandelier cell-pyramidal neuron connectivity exhibits distinctive developmental trajectories in the primate DLPFC, suggesting that disturbances in these trajectories could contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Recent findings that inputs from neocortical chandelier neurons are excitatory provide new ideas about the role of this circuitry in the pathophysiology of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

At least some of the core cognitive deficits of the illness appear to be the product of impaired gamma frequency oscillations which depend, in part, on the inhibitory actions of a subpopulation of cortical GABA neurons that express the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV). Recent studies have revealed new facets of the development of PV neurons in primate neocortex and of the nature of their molecular alterations in individuals with schizophrenia. Other recent studies in model systems provide insight into how these alterations may arise in the course of cortical circuitry development.},

  abstract    = {Deficits in cognitive control, a core disturbance of schizophrenia, appear to emerge from impaired prefrontal gamma oscillations. Cortical gamma oscillations require strong inhibitory inputs to pyramidal neurons from the parvalbumin basket cell (PVBC) class of GABAergic neurons. Recent findings indicate that schizophrenia is associated with multiple pre- and postsynaptic abnormalities in PVBCs, each of which weakens their inhibitory control of pyramidal cells. These findings suggest a new model of cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia in which PVBC inhibition is decreased to compensate for an upstream deficit in pyramidal cell excitation. This compensation is thought to rebalance cortical excitation and inhibition, but at a level insufficient to generate the gamma oscillation power required for high levels of cognitive control.},

Thus, knowledge of the connectivity between PFC pyramidal cells and interneurons is crucial to the understanding the neural mechanisms that subserve working memory. This paper reviews recent findings that reveal specificity in the spatial organization, synaptic targets and postnatal development of pyramidal cells and interneurons in the primate prefrontal cortex, and considers the relevance of these findings for the neural circuitry that subserves working memory.},

  abstract    = {In rodents, the hippocampus has been studied extensively as part of a brain system responsible for learning and memory, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) participates in numerous cognitive functions including working memory, flexibility, decision making, and rewarding learning. The neuronal projections from the hippocampus, either directly or indirectly, to the PFC, referred to as the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex (Hip-PFC) circuit, play a critical role in cognitive and emotional regulation and memory consolidation. Although in certain psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, structural connectivity viewed by imaging techniques has been consistently found to be associated with clinical phenotype and disease severity, the focus has moved towards the investigation of connectivity correlates of molecular pathology and coupling of oscillation. Moreover, functional and structural connectivity measures have been emerging as potential intermediate biomarkers for neuronal disorders. In this review, we summarize progress on the anatomic, molecular, and electrophysiological characters of the Hip-PFC circuit in cognition and emotion processes with an emphasis on oscillation and functional connectivity, revealing a disrupted Hip-PFC connectivity and electrical activity in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders as a promising candidate of neural marker for neuronal disorders.},

  abstract    = {Although the endogenous cannabinoid system modulates a variety of physiological and pharmacological processes, the specific role of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission and neural plasticity is not well understood. Using whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques, evoked or spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs or sEPSCs) were recorded from visualized, layer II/III pyramidal cells in frontal cortical slices from rat brain. Bath application of the CB1 receptor agonist, WIN 55212-2 (WIN), reduced the amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. When co-applied with the specific CB1 antagonists, AM251 or AM281, WIN did not suppress NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs. WIN also reduced the amplitude of evoked AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs, an effect that was also reversed by AM251. Both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs were significantly reduced by WIN. In contrast, WIN reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude of miniature EPSCs, suggesting that the suppression of glutamatergic activity by CB1 receptors in the frontal neocortex is mediated by a presynaptic mechanism. Taken together, these data indicate a critical role for endocannabinoid signaling in the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in frontal neocortex, and suggest a possible neuronal mechanism whereby THC regulates cortical function.},

  abstract    = {The intrahippocampal distribution of axon collaterals of individual CA3 pyramidal cells was investigated in the rat. Pyramidal cells in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were physiologically characterized and filled with biocytin in anesthetized animals. Their axonal trees were reconstructed with the aid of a drawing tube. Single CA3 pyramidal cells arborized most extensively in the CA1 region, covering approximately two-thirds of the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. The total length of axon collaterals in the CA3 region was less than in CA1 and the axon branches tended to cluster in narrow bands (200-800 microns), usually several hundred microns anterior or posterior to the cell body. The majority of the recurrent collaterals of a given neuron remained in the same subfield (CA3a, b, or c) as the parent cell. CA3a neurons innervated predominantly the basal dendrites, whereas neurons located proximal to the hilus (CA3c) terminated predominantly on the apical dendrites of both CA1 and CA3 cells. Two cells, with horizontal dendrites and numerous thorny excrescences at the CA3c-hilus transitional zone, were also labeled and projected to both CA3 and CA1 regions. All CA3 neurons projected some collaterals to the hilar region. Proximal (CA3c) neurons had numerous collaterals in the hilus proper. One CA3c pyramidal cell in the dorsal hippocampus sent an axon collaterals to the inner third of the molecular layer. CA3c pyramidal cells in the ventral hippocampus had extensive projections to the inner third of the dentate molecular layer, as well as numerous collaterals in the hilus, CA3, and CA1 areas, and several axon collaterals penetrated the subiculum. The total projected axon length of a single neuron ranged from 150 to 300 mm. On the basis of the projected axon length and bouton density (mean interbouton distance: 4.7 microns), we estimate that a single CA3 pyramidal cell can make synapses with 30,000-60,000 neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus. The concentrated distribution of the axon collaterals ("patches") indicates that subpopulations of neurons may receive disproportionately denser innervation, whereas innervation in the rest of the target zones is rather sparse. These observations offer new insights into the physiological organization of the CA3 pyramidal cell network.},

Thus, administration of PCP to rodents and nonhuman primates has been suggested to provide a potential animal model for schizophrenia. There have been some reports that 7-14 days of PCP administration can bring about enduring impairments in working memory in rodents but not all studies have been consistent in this regard. The present study determined whether repeated PCP administration impaired spatial performance in rats or mice trained to make minimal errors in an eight-arm radial maze task with a delay. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6J mice received 14 daily injection of vehicle or PCP (10 mg/kg, s.c.) followed by a withdrawal period of 1 week. The number of arm reentry errors and the distance traveled to complete the task were not significantly different between PCP-treated and vehicle-treated rats on 2, 8, and 14 days of PCP administration or 8 days following withdrawal of PCP. Mice treated with PCP for up to 2 weeks also had no significant differences in the number of arm reentry errors, travel distances, the numbers of visits to different arms during the first eight choices, or latencies to take all eight pellets compared to the vehicle-treated group. Thus, the present study failed to demonstrate that repeated administration of PCP to rats or mice produces enduring memory impairment. Factors potentially contributing to the discrepancies between various studies are discussed.},

  abstract    = {In this study, the hypothesis that haloperidol would lead to an amelioration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced 'psychotomimetic' effects was investigated. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial three-way crossover ascending dose study the effects of THC, haloperidol and their combination were investigated in 35 healthy, male mild cannabis users, measuring Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Visual Analogue Scales for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye measurements, electroencephalography, Body Sway, Stroop test, Visual and Verbal Learning Task, hormone levels and pharmacokinetics. Compared with placebo, THC significantly decreased smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales alertness, Stroop test performance, immediate and delayed word recall and prolactin concentrations, and significantly increased positive and general Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score, Visual Analogue Scales feeling high, Body Sway and electroencephalography alpha. Haloperidol reversed the THC-induced positive Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale increase to levels observed with haloperidol alone, but not THC-induced 'high' feelings. Compared with placebo, haloperidol significantly decreased saccadic peak velocity, smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales mood and immediate and delayed word recall and significantly increased Body Sway, electroencephalography theta and prolactin levels. THC-induced increases in positive Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale but not in Visual Analogue Scales feeling high were reversed by haloperidol. This indicates that psychotic-like effects induced by THC are mediated by dopaminergic systems, but that other systems are involved in 'feeling high'. Additionally, the clear reductions of psychotic-like symptoms by a clinically relevant dose of haloperidol suggest that THC administration may be a useful pharmacological cannabinoid model for psychotic effects in healthy volunteers.},

  abstract    = {GABAergic interneurones are diverse in their morphological and functional properties. Perisomatic inhibitory cells show fast spiking during sustained current injection, whereas dendritic inhibitory cells fire action potentials with lower frequency. We examined functional and molecular properties of K(+) channels in interneurones with horizontal dendrites in stratum oriens-alveus (OA) of the hippocampal CA1 region, which mainly comprise somatostatin-positive dendritic inhibitory cells. Voltage-gated K(+) currents in nucleated patches isolated from OA interneurones consisted of three major components: a fast delayed rectifier K(+) current component that was highly sensitive to external 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations < 0.1 mM for both blockers), a slow delayed rectifier K(+) current component that was sensitive to high concentrations of TEA, but insensitive to 4-AP, and a rapidly inactivating A-type K(+) current component that was blocked by high concentrations of 4-AP, but resistant to TEA. The relative contributions of these components to the macroscopic K(+) current were estimated as 57 +/- 5, 25 +/- 6, and 19 +/- 2 \%, respectively. Dendrotoxin, a selective blocker of Kv1 channels had only minimal effects on K(+) currents in nucleated patches. Coapplication of the membrane-permeant cAMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP) and the phosphodiesterase blocker isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) resulted in a selective inhibition of the fast delayed rectifier K(+) current component. This inhibition was absent in the presence of the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89, implying the involvement of PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed a high abundance of Kv3.2 mRNA in OA interneurones, whereas the expression level of Kv3.1 mRNA was markedly lower. Similarly, RT-PCR analysis showed a high abundance of Kv4.3 mRNA, whereas Kv4.2 mRNA was undetectable. This suggests that the fast delayed rectifier K(+) current and the A-type K(+) current component are mediated predominantly by homomeric Kv3.2 and Kv4.3 channels. Selective modulation of Kv3.2 channels in OA interneurones by cAMP is likely to be an important factor regulating the activity of dendritic inhibitory cells in principal neurone-interneurone microcircuits.},

  abstract    = {P50 suppression is viewed as an operational measure of sensory "gating" that is reduced in patients with schizophrenia and their family members. Previous reports have demonstrated that neural gating is regulated by monoaminergic tone in rodent models of P50 suppression.In this study, 11 healthy subjects participated in P50 event-related potential recordings at baseline and after either oral administration of dextroamphetamine (.3 mg/kg) or placebo, to determine if the administration of a monoaminergic agonist produces P50 suppression deficits similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia.As hypothesized, amphetamine disrupted the suppression of the P50 event-related potential. There was a statistically significant decrement in P50 suppression during the amphetamine challenge condition (t10 = 3.15, p < .01, mean difference = -44.1\%, d = -2.5) relative to the baseline P50 condition. A comparison of P50 suppression in the placebo and amphetamine conditions (both after a baseline recording session) revealed a significant amphetamine-induced disruption of P50 suppression (t6 = 3.71, p < .01, mean difference = -54.4\%, d = -3.14).The biochemical alterations associated with an amphetamine-induced disruption of P50 suppression in this study may be related to the pathophysiology of P50 suppression deficits in schizophrenia. The findings are consistent with several careful examinations of suppression deficits in rodent models that have identified the monoaminergic regulation of P50 suppression. These data indicate that amphetamine induces a disruption of P50 suppression in normal subjects.},

  abstract    = {The involvement of non-cannabinoid neurotransmitter systems in the abuse-related behavioral effects of cannabis has not been well characterized in humans. GABAergic drugs have overlapping effects with cannabis and Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) on certain behavioral measures, but those measures lack the specificity to draw conclusions regarding the involvement of GABA in cannabinoid effects. The aim of this study was to assess the separate and combined effects of the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine and Δ(9)-THC using more pharmacologically specific drug-discrimination procedures.Eight cannabis users learned to discriminate 30 mg oral Δ(9)-THC from placebo and then received tiagabine (6 and 12 mg), Δ(9)-THC (5, 15 and 30 mg) and placebo, alone and in combination. Self-report, task performance and physiological measures were also collected.Δ(9)-THC produced subjective effects typically associated with cannabinoids (e.g., High, Stoned, Like Drug), elevated heart rate and impaired rate and accuracy on psychomotor performance tasks. The higher tiagabine dose substituted for the Δ(9)-THC discriminative stimulus and engendered subjective and performance-impairing effects that overlapped with those of Δ(9)-THC when administered alone. In combination, tiagabine shifted the discriminative-stimulus effects of Δ(9)-THC leftward/upward and enhanced Δ(9)-THC effects on other outcomes.These results indicate that GABA is involved in the clinical effects of Δ(9)-THC, and by extension, cannabis. Future studies should test selective GABAergic compounds to determine which receptor subtype(s) are responsible for the effects observed when combined with cannabinoids.},

  abstract    = {The growth and metastases of many solid tumors are dependent on the recruitment of new blood vessels. Tumor angiogenesis is most likely initiated by paracrine release of growth factors that bind to their corresponding endothelial cell surface receptors. To determine whether angiogenesis and growth factor receptor expression are consistent findings in malignant melanoma, primary human melanomas were examined for mRNA expression of receptors for fibroblast growth factors (FGFR-1, FGFR-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2), and the receptors Tiel and Tie2. Charts were reviewed and archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumors were obtained from patients with thin (<1 mm; n = 10), intermediate (1 to 4 mm; n = 10), or thick malignant melanoma (>4 mm; n = 8). Also examined was whether melanoma cell lines could induce endothelial growth factor receptor synthesis by metabolic labeling. It was found that tumor vascularity did not correlate with clinical stage, melanoma thickness, or clinical outcome. It was also found that melanoma cell lines were not capable of directly regulating endothelial cell synthesis of growth factor receptors. However, expression of Tiel and VEGFR-2 mRNA by the tumor vasculature in select stage IA-IIB patients, and FGFR-1 mRNA expression by the tumor cells in the same clinical stages was found. The expression of these growth factor receptors did not correlate with clinical outcome. These data suggest that angiogenesis is not a prominent characteristic of primary malignant melanoma lesions and that the endothelial cell expression of Tiel and VEGFR-2 in vivo is probably not directly induced by the tumor.},

  abstract    = {Electrical extracellular recordings, i.e., recordings of the electrical potentials in the extracellular medium between cells, have been a main work-horse in electrophysiology for almost a century. The high-frequency part of the signal (≳500 Hz), i.e., the multi-unit activity (MUA), contains information about the firing of action potentials in surrounding neurons, while the low-frequency part, the local field potential (LFP), contains information about how these neurons integrate synaptic inputs. As the recorded extracellular signals arise from multiple neural processes, their interpretation is typically ambiguous and difficult. Fortunately, a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking activity at the cellular level and the recorded signal has been established: the extracellular potential can be calculated as a weighted sum of all transmembrane currents in all cells located in the vicinity of the electrode. This computational scheme can considerably aid the modeling and analysis of MUA and LFP signals. Here, we describe LFPy, an open source Python package for numerical simulations of extracellular potentials. LFPy consists of a set of easy-to-use classes for defining cells, synapses and recording electrodes as Python objects, implementing this biophysical modeling scheme. It runs on top of the widely used NEURON simulation environment, which allows for flexible usage of both new and existing cell models. Further, calculation of extracellular potentials using the line-source-method is efficiently implemented. We describe the theoretical framework underlying the extracellular potential calculations and illustrate by examples how LFPy can be used both for simulating LFPs, i.e., synaptic contributions from single cells as well a populations of cells, and MUAs, i.e., extracellular signatures of action potentials.},

  abstract    = {In the hippocampus, oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency range occur together and interact in several ways, indicating that they are part of a common functional system. It is argued that these oscillations form a coding scheme that is used in the hippocampus to organize the readout from long-term memory of the discrete sequence of upcoming places, as cued by current position. This readout of place cells has been analyzed in several ways. First, plots of the theta phase of spikes vs. position on a track show a systematic progression of phase as rats run through a place field. This is termed the phase precession. Second, two cells with nearby place fields have a systematic difference in phase, as indicated by a cross-correlation having a peak with a temporal offset that is a significant fraction of a theta cycle. Third, several different decoding algorithms demonstrate the information content of theta phase in predicting the animal's position. It appears that small phase differences corresponding to jitter within a gamma cycle do not carry information. This evidence, together with the finding that principle cells fire preferentially at a given gamma phase, supports the concept of theta/gamma coding: a given place is encoded by the spatial pattern of neurons that fire in a given gamma cycle (the exact timing within a gamma cycle being unimportant); sequential places are encoded in sequential gamma subcycles of the theta cycle (i.e., with different discrete theta phase). It appears that this general form of coding is not restricted to readout of information from long-term memory in the hippocampus because similar patterns of theta/gamma oscillations have been observed in multiple brain regions, including regions involved in working memory and sensory integration. It is suggested that dual oscillations serve a general function: the encoding of multiple units of information (items) in a way that preserves their serial order. The relationship of such coding to that proposed by Singer and von der Malsburg is discussed; in their scheme, theta is not considered. It is argued that what theta provides is the absolute phase reference needed for encoding order. Theta/gamma coding therefore bears some relationship to the concept of "word" in digital computers, with word length corresponding to the number of gamma cycles within a theta cycle, and discrete phase corresponding to the ordered "place" within a word.},

At this juncture, while many questions remain unanswered, achievements in several areas of research have made it possible to relate specific properties of brain networks to cognitive functions.

  abstract    = {Many risk genes interact synergistically to produce schizophrenia and many neurotransmitter interactions have been implicated. We have developed a circuit-based framework for understanding gene and neurotransmitter interactions. NMDAR hypofunction has been implicated in schizophrenia because NMDAR antagonists reproduce symptoms of the disease. One action of antagonists is to reduce the excitation of fast-spiking interneurons, resulting in disinhibition of pyramidal cells. Overactive pyramidal cells, notably those in the hippocampus, can drive a hyperdopaminergic state that produces psychosis. Additional aspects of interneuron function can be understood in this framework, as follows. (i) In animal models, NMDAR antagonists reduce parvalbumin and GAD67, as found in schizophrenia. These changes produce further disinhibition and can be viewed as the aberrant response of a homeostatic system having a faulty activity sensor (the NMDAR). (ii) Disinhibition decreases the power of gamma oscillation and might thereby produce negative and cognitive symptoms. (iii) Nicotine enhances the output of interneurons, and might thereby contribute to its therapeutic effect in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction model of schizophrenia is based on the ability of NMDAR antagonists to produce many symptoms of the disease. Recent work in rats shows that NMDAR antagonist works synergistically with dopamine to produce delta frequency bursting in the thalamus. This finding, together with other results in the literature, suggests a mechanism for the sudden onset of schizophrenia. Among the thalamic nuclei most activated by NMDAR antagonist is the nucleus reuniens. This nucleus excites the cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus. Experiments indicate that such activation can lead to excitation of dopaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area by a polysynaptic pathway. The resulting elevation of dopamine in the thalamus will enhance thalamic bursting, thereby creating a loop with the potential for positive feedback. We show through computer simulations that in individuals with susceptibility to schizophrenia (e.g., because of partially compromised NMDAR function), an event that stimulates the dopamine system, such as stress, can cause the system to reach the threshold for thalamic bursting. When this occurs, positive feedback in the loop will cause all components to become highly active and to remain active after the triggering stimulus is removed. This is a physiologically specific hypothesis for the sudden and lasting transition that underlies the psychotic break in schizophrenia. Furthermore, the model provides an explanation for the observed selective activation of the CA1 hippocampal region in schizophrenia. The model also predicts an increase of basal activity in the dopamine system and thalamus; the relevant evidence is reviewed.},

In contrast, large alterations in the BOLD MR signal were observed with R(-) isomer, whereas S(+) isomer and racemate precipitated more localized BOLD signal changes predominantly in cortical, hippocampal and hindbrain regions. Glucose utilization rates in conscious animals are in agreement with previously published data and verify the BOLD responses in the racemic group. However, no significant changes in glucose utilization were observed in the anesthetized cohort.Ketamine and its isomers have stereospecific effects on sensorimotor gating and locomotion that correlate with the enantiomer's affinity for the NMDA receptor. It would appear that anesthesia, as required for preclinical MRI procedures, may interact with and potentially attenuate the drug's response. Although analysis of the main effect of isomers in comparison to each other or the racemate offers an alternative analysis method that should be less susceptible to anesthetic interactions, only the R(-) isomer comparative to the racemate offers significant differences of interest.},

The general lack of glutamate receptor saturation leaves room for increases in [glu]cleft as a mechanism for synaptic plasticity.},

Such rhythmicity is involved in the genesis of cognition, in the sleep-wake cycle, and in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. The role of GABA-mediated transmission in regulating these functional states is addressed here. At the cortical level, inhibition determines the spread of cortical activation by sculpting the precise activity patterns that underlie the details of cognition and motor control. At the thalamic level, GABA-mediated inhibition modulates and resets distribution of the ongoing thalamocortical rhythmic oscillations that bind multisensory inputs into a single cognitive experience and regulate arousal levels.},

Intracellular calcium concentration microdomains on the order of 200 to 300 micromolar occur against the cytoplasmic surface of the plasmalemma during transmitter secretion, supporting the view that the synaptic vesicular fusion responsible for transmitter release is triggered by the activation of a low-affinity calcium-binding site at the active zone.},

  abstract    = {We propose a top-down approach to the symptoms of schizophrenia based on a statistical dynamical framework. We show that a reduced depth in the basins of attraction of cortical attractor states destabilizes the activity at the network level due to the constant statistical fluctuations caused by the stochastic spiking of neurons. In integrate-and-fire network simulations, a decrease in the NMDA receptor conductances, which reduces the depth of the attractor basins, decreases the stability of short-term memory states and increases distractibility. The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia such as distractibility, working memory deficits, or poor attention could be caused by this instability of attractor states in prefrontal cortical networks. Lower firing rates are also produced, and in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex could account for the negative symptoms, including a reduction of emotions. Decreasing the GABA as well as the NMDA conductances produces not only switches between the attractor states, but also jumps from spontaneous activity into one of the attractors. We relate this to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including delusions, paranoia, and hallucinations, which may arise because the basins of attraction are shallow and there is instability in temporal lobe semantic memory networks, leading thoughts to move too freely round the attractor energy landscape.},

Enhancement of transmitter release by 50 {microM} 4-aminopyridine or by elevated extracellular Ca2+ (up to 5 {mM)} resulted in a substantial increase in the peak excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude and in the significant stimulus-dependent prolongation of the excitatory postsynaptic current decay. The stronger the stimulus, the slower the excitatory postsynaptic current decay became. The pharmacologically isolated {N-methyl-D-aspartate}, but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid component of the excitatory postsynaptic current exhibited this phenomenon. The possible connection of such behaviour of the {N-methyl-D-aspartate} component to the loss of voltage control was tested in the following way: the peak of the {N-methyl-D-aspartate} component was enhanced under 50 {microM} 4-aminopyridine and then returned back to the control level by a low dose of D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. However, the decay of the decreased {N-methyl-D-aspartate} component remained slow suggesting another origin of the stimulus-dependent kinetics. Dihydrokainate, a non-competitive inhibitor of glutamate uptake, did not influence the kinetics of the {N-methyl-D-aspartate} component in control but induced its dramatic stimulus-dependent prolongation when applied on the background of a low dose of 4-aminopyridine (10 {microM)} which did not affect the decay by itself. We propose that the delayed stimulus-dependent kinetics of the {N-methyl-D-aspartate} component is due to the saturation of uptake mechanisms and subsequent activation of extrasynaptic {N-methyl-D-aspartate} receptors. Our present observations therefore support the hypothesis that {N-methyl-D-aspartate} receptors may play a role in the cross-talk between synapses by means of the transmitter spillover.},

  abstract    = {Early in the twentieth century, von Economo provided the first evidence linking the hypothalamus with sleep-wake behavior. His studies concluded that the anterior hypothalamus was associated with sleep, whereas the posterior hypothalamus was associated with waking. In the decades following these observations, a wealth of research has shown that an elaborate circuitry comprising a number of brain regions, cell types, and extracellular messengers underlies sleep-wake behavior. In this review, we discuss data generated in the past 10 years that highlight the role of the hypothalamus in sleep-wake behavior and control. In particular, we will focus on the identification of the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) as a sleep center and the hypocretin/orexin cells in the perifornical region of the hypothalamus as constituting a waking center; these two centers are critical for the maintenance of normal sleep-wake architecture, and provide a foundation for our understanding of sleep-wake behavior and its underlying physiology. The data from these and other regions traditionally associated with the sleep-wake cycle have led to a flip-flop switch model of sleep-wake control. The switch is composed of two sets of mutually inhibitory groups of neurons: a sleep group and an arousal group, with the latter modulated by orexin-containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. The sleep-promoting GABA (gamma-amino-butyric acid) receptor agonists are a diverse class of drugs, which include barbiturates, benzodiazepines, chloral hydrate, ethanol, and gaseous anesthetics, that have been used to study sleep physiology for many years. Recent studies suggest that these drugs may exert their hypnotic effects in a regionally specific manner. For example, some GABAA agonists appear to promote sleep by inhibiting the histaminergic cells in the tuberomammillary nucleus and weakly activating the VLPO via agonist binding to the alpha1 subunit of GABAA receptors; whereas, gaboxadol (THIP; 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) binds to the alpha4delta-subunits, potentially promoting sleep by activation of the VLPO. The integration of these data into the flip-flop switch model can be used to better understand sleep-wake control and augment existing therapeutic treatments for sleep disorders.},

  abstract    = {The distribution of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor was studied in the monkey basal forebrain by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy, using an antibody to the CB1 brain cannabinoid receptor. Large numbers of labelled neurons were observed in the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The labelled neurons had dimensions similar to those of cholinergic neurons and were larger than those of GABAergic neurons. Double immunolabelling with an antibody to the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) showed that CB1-positive neurons were also positive for ChAT, whilst electron microscopy confirmed that CB1-labelled neurons contained lipofuscin granules and dense clusters of rough endoplasmic reticulum, characteristic of cholinergic neurons. The dense labelling of cholinergic neurons for CB1 is interesting from the standpoint of neuroprotection. The CB1 receptor has been shown to couple in an inhibitory manner to voltage dependent calcium channels, and the dense labelling of CB1 in cholinergic neurons would therefore suggest that CB1 receptors could be important in limiting calcium influx through voltage dependent calcium channels in these neurons. This could serve to limit intracellular calcium concentrations, and consequent calcium mediated injury, in these neurons.},

However, the neural pathways that mediate context-reward relations are not well understood. We have identified a circuit from area CA3 of dorsal hippocampus to ventral tegmental area (VTA) that uses lateral septum (LS) as a relay. Theta frequency stimulation of CA3 excited VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and inhibited non-DA neurons. DA neuron excitation was likely mediated by disinhibition because local antagonism of γ-aminobutyric acid receptors blocked responses to CA3 stimulation. Inactivating components of the CA3-LS-VTA pathway blocked evoked responses in VTA and also reinstatement of cocaine-seeking by contextual stimuli. This transsynaptic link between hippocampus and VTA appears to be an important substrate by which environmental context regulates goal-directed behavior.},

  abstract  = {Epilepsy is a complex set of disorders that can involve many areas of the cortex, as well as underlying deep-brain systems. The myriad manifestations of seizures, which can be as varied as déjà vu and olfactory hallucination, can therefore give researchers insights into regional functions and relations. Epilepsy is also complex genetically and pathophysiologically: it involves microscopic (on the scale of ion channels and synaptic proteins), macroscopic (on the scale of brain trauma and rewiring) and intermediate changes in a complex interplay of causality. It has long been recognized that computer modelling will be required to disentangle causality, to better understand seizure spread and to understand and eventually predict treatment efficacy. Over the past few years, substantial progress has been made in modelling epilepsy at levels ranging from the molecular to the socioeconomic. We review these efforts and connect them to the medical goals of understanding and treating the disorder.},

  abstract    = {1. The interaction between inhibitory interneurons and cortical pyramidal neurons was studied by use of computer simulations to test whether inhibitory interneurons could assist in phase-locking postsynaptic cells. Two models were used: a simplified model, which included only 3 membrane channels, and a detailed 11-channel model. 2. The 11-channel model included most of the ion channels known to be present in neocortical pyramidal neurons as well as calcium diffusion and other membrane mechanisms. The kinetics for the channels were obtained from voltage-clamp studies in a variety of preparations. The parameters were then adjusted to produce repetitive bursting similar to that seen in some cortical pyramidal cells entrained during visual stimulation. 3. Phase-locking to a train of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) located on or near the soma was observed in the 3-channel model cell subjected to random synaptic bombardment. In the 11-channel model, phase-locking due to multiple IPSPs was compared with phase-locking due to multiple excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Phase-locking began to occur when 20\% of the IPSPs (20/100) or 40\% of the EPSPs (4,000/10,000) were synchronized. The exact percentages differed with different 11-channel models, but either EPSPs or IPSPs would generally produce entrainment with approximately 40\% synchronization. Thus 40 inhibitory boutons had an effect equivalent to 4,000 excitatory boutons in producing phase-locking. 4. Phase-locking with IPSPs in these models was possible because the IPSPs could cause either an increase or a decrease in firing rate over a limited range. The IPSPs served a modulatory role, increasing the rate of firing in some cases and decreasing it in others, depending on the state of the cell. 5. We examined frequency entrainment by IPSPs. In the 3-channel model, frequency entrainment of a postsynaptic cell was observed with a rapid train of strong (20-100 nS), brief, compound IPSPs. A 40-Hz compound IPSP train of 60 nS entrained cells having initial firing rates between 32 and 47 Hz. Below this range, cells could be partially entrained. Above the range, entrainment would fail. Frequency entrainment in the 3-channel model generally occurred on the first cycle after onset of the IPSPs. 6. Phase-locking and frequency entrainment were less robust in the 11-channel model. This was partly because bursts rather than individual spikes were being entrained. A 40-Hz, 90-nS compound IPSP train entrained a model cell upward from 34 Hz. Downward frequency entrainment also occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract    = {The involvement of the septohippocampal system on the impaired sensorimotor gating induced by phencyclidine (PCP) or by an electrically induced hippocampal seizure was examined in behaving rats. An impaired sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, was observed following a hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) or systemic injection of PCP and was accompanied with an increase in hippocampal gamma waves (30-70 Hz). The medial septum infusion with muscimol (0.25 microg), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 15 min prior to PCP or a hippocampal AD, prevented the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in gamma waves. By itself, muscimol (0.25 microg) injection into the medial septum did not affect PPI, although it significantly suppressed spontaneous gamma waves. In order to identify subpopulations of neurons mediating the sensorimotor gating deficit and the hippocampal gamma wave increase, 0.14-0.21 microg of p75 antibody conjugated to saporin (192 IgG-saporin) was injected into the medial septum to selectively lesion the septohippocampal cholinergic neurons. Neither the PPI deficit nor the gamma wave increase induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD was affected by 192 IgG-saporin lesion of the medial septum. It is concluded that increase in neural activity in the medial septum participates in the impairment of sensorimotor gating and the increase in hippocampal gamma waves induced by PCP or a hippocampal AD. It is suggested that the GABAergic but not the cholinergic septohippocampal neurons mediate the sensorimotor gating deficit.},

We argue that the field will be unable to address these challenges within psychiatry's standard neo-Kraepelinian (DSM) perspective. At the same time the current corrective, based in molecular genetics and cognitive neuroscience, is also likely to flounder due to its neglect for psychiatry's syndromal structure. We suggest adopting a new approach long used in reliability engineering, which also serves as a synthesis of these approaches. This approach, known as fault tree analysis, can be combined with extant neuroscientific data collection and computational modeling efforts to uncover the causal structures underlying the cognitive and affective failures in people with schizophrenia as well as other complex psychiatric phenomena. By making explicit how causes combine from basic faults to downstream failures, this approach makes affordances for: (1) causes that are neither necessary nor sufficient in and of themselves; (2) within-diagnosis heterogeneity; and (3) between diagnosis co-morbidity.},

  abstract    = {Striatal output neurons (SONs) integrate glutamatergic synaptic inputs originating from the cerebral cortex. In vivo electrophysiological data have shown that a prior depolarization of SONs induced a short-term (</=1 sec) increase in their membrane excitability, which facilitated the ability of corticostriatal synaptic potentials to induce firing. Here we propose, using a computational model of SONs, that the use-dependent, short-term increase in the responsiveness of SONs mainly results from the slow kinetics of a voltage-dependent, slowly inactivating potassium A-current. This mechanism confers on SONs a form of intrinsic short-term memory that optimizes the synaptic input-output relationship as a function of their past activation.},

We administered subanesthetic doses of the {NMDA} receptor antagonist ketamine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design to 13 neuroleptic-free schizophrenic patients to investigate if schizophrenics will experience an exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairments with ketamine. We also examined whether schizophrenics experienced quantitative or qualitative differences in ketamine response in comparison to normal controls. Schizophrenics experienced a brief-ketamine-induced exacerbation of positive and negative symptoms with further decrements in recall and recognition memory. They also displayed greater ketamine-induced impairments in free recall than normals. Qualitative differences included auditory hallucinations and paranoia in patients but not in normals. These data indicate that ketamine is associated with exacerbation of core psychotic and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Moreover, ketamine may differentially affect cognition in schizophrenics in comparison to normal controls.},

Here, we examine the cellular and network mechanisms underlying carbachol-induced fast network oscillations in the hippocampus in vitro, which closely resemble hippocampal gamma oscillations in the behaving rat. Using a combination of planar multielectrode array recordings, imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes, and recordings from single hippocampal neurons within the CA3 gamma generator, active current sinks and sources were localized to the stratum pyramidale. These proximal currents were driven by phase-locked rhythmic inhibitory inputs to pyramidal cells from identified perisomatic-targeting interneurons. AMPA receptor-mediated recurrent excitation was necessary for the synchronization of interneuronal discharge, which strongly supports a synaptic feedback model for the generation of hippocampal gamma oscillations.},

  abstract    = {In the CNS, endocannabinoids are identified mainly as two endogenous lipids: anandamide, the ethanolamide of arachidonic acid, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Endocannabinoids are known to inhibit transmitter release from presynaptic terminals; however we have recently demonstrated that they are also involved in slow self-inhibition (SSI) of layer V low-threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons in rat somatosensory cortex. SSI is induced by repetitive firing in LTS cells, which can express either cholecystokinin or somatostatin. SSI is triggered by an endocannabinoid-dependent activation of a prolonged somatodendritic K(+) conductance and associated hyperpolarization in the same cell. The synthesis of both endocannabinoids is dependent on elevated [Ca(2+)](i) such as occurs during sustained neuronal activity. To establish whether 2-AG mediates autocrine LTS-SSI, we blocked its biosynthesis from phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol lipases (DAGLs). Current-clamp recordings from LTS interneurons in acute neocortical slices showed that inclusion of DAGL inhibitors in the whole-cell pipette prevented the long-lasting hyperpolarization triggered by LTS cell repetitive firing. Similarly, extracellular applications of a PLC inhibitor prevented SSI in LTS interneurons. Moreover, metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent activation of PLC produced a long-lasting hyperpolarization which was prevented by the CB1 antagonist AM251, as well as by PLC and DAGL inhibitors. The loss of SSI in the presence of intracellular DAGL blockers confirms that endocannabinoid production occurs in the same interneuron undergoing the persistent hyperpolarization. Since DAGLs produce no endocannabinoid other than 2-AG, these results identify this compound as the autocrine mediator responsible for the postsynaptic slow self-inhibition of neocortical LTS interneurons.},

The quest to unravel the blueprint of this template started more than a century ago and has revealed an immensely intricate design. The largest obstacle is the daunting variety of inhibitory interneurons that are found in the circuit. This review focuses on the organizing principles that govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits.},

In nucleated patches isolated from basket cells of the dentate gyrus, a fast delayed rectifier K+ current component that was highly sensitive to tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations <0.1 mM) predominated, contributing an average of 58\% to the total K+ current in these cells. By contrast, in pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region a rapidly inactivating A-type K+ current component that was TEA-resistant prevailed, contributing 61\% to the total K+ current. Both types of neurons also showed small amounts of the K+ current component mainly found in the other type of neuron and, in addition, a slow delayed rectifier K+ current component with intermediate properties (slow inactivation, intermediate sensitivity to TEA). Single-cell RT-PCR analysis of mRNA revealed that Kv3 (Kv3.1, Kv3.2) subunit transcripts were expressed in almost all (89\%) of the interneurons but only in 17\% of the pyramidal neurons. In contrast, Kv4 (Kv4.2, Kv4.3) subunit mRNAs were present in 87\% of pyramidal neurons but only in 55\% of interneurons. Selective block of fast delayed rectifier K+ channels, presumably assembled from Kv3 subunits, by 4-AP reduced substantially the action potential frequency in interneurons. These results indicate that the differential expression of Kv3 and Kv4 subunits shapes the action potential phenotypes of principal neurons and interneurons in the cortex.},

  abstract    = {The expression of the alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is diminished in selected brain areas of patients with schizophrenia. This diminished expression may account for the pathophysiological deficits of sensory inhibition and smooth pursuit eye movement performance in these patients. Furthermore, the deficits in sensory inhibition and smooth pursuit eye movement performance in schizophrenia appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion; thus, the "alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-deficiency" may be a necessary condition for expression of schizophrenia. This deficit has encouraged speculation about the possible therapeutic benefit of selective alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist interventions in this disorder. In view of this, we sought to examine the effect of anabasine, a selective alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, on popping behavior in mice elicited by MK-801. MK-801, a high affinity analogue of phencyclidine (PCP), is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist that binds to the hydrophobic domain of this ligand-gated channel. PCP is known to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals, causing productive (e.g. hallucinations) deficit (e.g. affective blunting, amotivation, and social withdrawal), cognitive and motor symptoms similar to those seen in naturally-occurring schizophrenia. Behaviors elicited by MK-801 in mice reflect a pharmacologically-induced state of NMDA receptor hypofunction (NRH), which has been proposed to exist in schizophrenia. Compounds that attenuate MK-801-elicited behaviors, which are identified in this animal model, may have the potential to treat schizophrenia, including deficit and cognitive symptoms. In the current study, anabasine attenuated MK-801-elicited popping at a dose that did not cause clonic seizures. The development of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist interventions for schizophrenia must consider their potential liability to elicit seizure activity.},

We utilized positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) infusion on brain blood flow and its behavioral correlates in 46 volunteers. Consistent with previous reports, there was a significant increase in cortical and cerebellar blood flow following THC, but not all subjects showed this effect. Those who showed a decrease in cerebellar CBF also had a significant alteration in time sense. The relationship between decreased cerebellar flow and impaired time sense is of interest because the cerebellum has been linked to an internal timing system.},

  abstract    = {The number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs affect the integrative properties of neurons. These parameters have been studied recently for several hippocampal neuron populations. Besides parvalbumin- (PV) containing cells that include basket and axo-axonic cells, cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing interneurons also form a basket cell population with several properties distinct from PV cells. Here, at the light microscopic level, we reconstructed the entire dendritic tree of CCK-immunoreactive (IR) basket cells to describe their geometry, the total length and laminar distribution of their dendrites. This was followed by an electron microscopic analysis of serial ultrathin sections immunostained against gamma-aminobutyric acid, to estimate the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on their somata, axon initial segments and different subclasses of dendrites. The dendritic tree of CCK-IR basket cells has an average length of 6300 microm and penetrates all layers. At the electron microscopic level, CCK basket cells receive dendritic inputs with a density of 80-230 per 100 microm. The ratio of inhibitory inputs is relatively high (35\%) and increases towards the soma (83\%). The total numbers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses converging onto CCK-IR cells are approximately 8200. Comparison of the two, neurochemically distinct basket cells reveals that CCK-containing basket cells receive much less synaptic input than PV cells; however, the relative weight of inhibition is higher on CCK cells. Additional differences in their anatomical and physiological properties predict that CCK basket cells are under a more diverse, elaborate control than PV basket cells, and thus the function of the two populations must be different.},

We review event-related potentials abnormalities (ERPs) in schizophrenia that may be related to dysfunction in this brain region or its inputs; ERPs discussed include the N100/P200, P300 and N400 components. Additional CT and clinical data have led our laboratory to a unifying working hypothesis of the presence of temporal lobe damage in schizophrenics that is evinced electrophysiologically as ERP alterations, structurally as tissue loss/derangement, and clinically as positive symptoms. The final section of this paper presents a new model of at least one form of schizophrenic pathology that, while speculative, incorporates experimentally based data from both our ERP work and from basic cellular physiology and pharmacology. The model proposes that positive symptoms of schizophrenia are related to limbic system pathology and in particular to a dysregulation of the NMDA form of excitatory amino acid transmission, potentiated by stress, and leading to cell damage and death due to 'excitotoxicity'.},

The mechanisms underlying these pathological beta oscillations remain elusive. Here, using mathematical models, we find that robust beta oscillations can emerge from inhibitory interactions between striatal medium spiny neurons. The interaction of the synaptic GABAa currents and the intrinsic membrane M-current promotes population oscillations in the beta frequency range. Increased levels of cholinergic drive, a condition relevant to the parkinsonian striatum, lead to enhanced beta oscillations in the striatal model. We show experimentally that direct infusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol into the striatum, but not into the neighboring cortex, of the awake, normal rodent induces prominent beta frequency oscillations in the local field potential. These results provide evidence for amplification of normal striatal network dynamics as a mechanism responsible for the enhanced beta frequency oscillations in Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract    = {This study investigated the acute effects of delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on four behavioral measures of impulsivity in recreational marijuana users. Although impulsive behavior has been studied using several different measures of impulsivity, few studies have utilized more than one of these measures on a single cohort. In this study, 37 healthy men and women participated in three sessions, in which they received capsules containing placebo, 7.5, or 15 mg THC in randomized order under double-blind conditions. Subjects were tested on the following four tasks: the Stop task, which measures the ability to inhibit a prepotent motor response; a Go/no-go task; a Delay discounting task, which measures the value of delayed or uncertain reinforcers; and a time estimation task, which measures alterations in time perception through a time reproduction procedure. Subjects also completed mood questionnaires and general measures of performance. THC produced its expected effects on subjective measures including increases in ARCI euphoria and marijuana scales. THC increased impulsive responding on the Stop task but did not affect performance on either the Go/no-go or Delay or Probability discounting tasks. On the time reproduction task, THC increased estimates of the duration of short intervals while not affecting estimates of longer intervals. There were no significant correlations between the four tasks either before or after drug administration. These results suggest that THC may increase certain forms of impulsive behavior while not affecting other impulsive behaviors. The dissociations between the four measures of impulsivity suggest that impulsivity is an assemblage of distinct components rather than a unitary process.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia (Sz), along with other neuropsychiatric disorders, is associated clinically with abnormalities in neocortical gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations. In Sz patients, these abnormalities include both increased and decreased gamma activity, and show a strong association with Sz symptoms. For several decades, administration of sub-anesthetic levels of ketamine has provided the most comprehensive experimental model of Sz-symptoms. While acute application of ketamine precipitates a psychotic-like state in a number of animal models, as well as humans, the underlying mechanisms behind this effect, including alteration of neuronal network properties, are incompletely understood, making an in vitro level analysis particularly important. Previous in vitro studies have had difficulty inducing gamma oscillations in neocortical slices maintained in submerged-type recording chambers necessary for visually guided whole-cell recordings from identified neurons. Consequently, here, we validated a modified method to evoke gamma oscillations using brief, focal application of the glutamate receptor agonist kainate (KA), in slices prepared from mice expressing green fluorescent protein in GABAergic interneurons (GAD67-GFP knock-in mice). Using this method, gamma oscillations dependent on activation of AMPA and GABA(A) receptors were reliably elicited in slices containing mouse prelimbic cortex, the rodent analogue of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Examining the effects of ketamine on this model, we found that bath application of ketamine significantly potentiated KA-elicited gamma power, an effect mimicked by selective NMDAR antagonists including a selective antagonist of NMDARs containing the NR2B subunit. Importantly, ketamine, unlike more specific NMDAR antagonists, also reduced the peak frequency of KA-elicited oscillatory activity. Our findings indicate that this effect is mediated not through NMDAR, but through slowing the decay kinetics of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in identified GABAergic interneurons. These in vitro findings may help explain the complexities of gamma findings in clinical studies of Sz and prove useful in developing new therapeutic strategies.},

Because of the methodological difficulties in modulating sleep, however, a causal link between specific sleep features and human memory consolidation is lacking. Here, we experimentally manipulated specific sleep features during a daytime nap via direct pharmacological intervention. Using zolpidem (Ambien), a short-acting GABAA agonist hypnotic, we show increased sleep spindle density and decreased REM sleep compared with placebo and sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Naps with increased spindles produced significantly better verbal memory and significantly worse perceptual learning but did not affect motor learning. The experimental spindles were similar to control spindles in amplitude and frequency, suggesting that the experimental intervention enhanced normal sleep processes. Furthermore, using statistical methods, we demonstrate for the first time a critical role of spindles in human hippocampal memory performance. The gains in memory consolidation exceed sleep-alone or control conditions and demonstrate the potential for targeted, exceptional memory enhancement in healthy adults with pharmacologically modified sleep.},

  abstract    = {The integrative properties of neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single cell.A single pyramidal cell has approximately 12,000 microm dendrites and receives around 30,000 excitatory and 1700 inhibitory inputs, of which 40 \% are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20 \% on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The pre- and post-synaptic features suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68.5 \% of the pyramidal cells' dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while inhibitory inputs target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of inhibitory inputs on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low ( approximately 3 \%). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70-100 \%) inhibitory inputs. Only inhibitory inputs innervate the somata (77-103 per cell) and axon initial segments. Dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare possess moderate to small amounts of spines. Excitatory synapses on stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites are larger than the synapses in other layers, are frequently perforated ( approximately 40 \%) and can be located on dendritic shafts. Inhibitory inputs, whose percentage is relatively high ( approximately 14-17 \%), also terminate on dendritic spines. Our results indicate that: (i) the highly convergent excitation arriving onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells is primarily controlled by proximally located inhibition; (ii) the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in layers receiving Schaffer collateral input (radiatum/oriens) versus perforant path input (lacunosum-moleculare) is significantly different.},

After completion of the online and post-stimulation working memory tasks, participants were asked to rate the level of success-confidence on the two preceding working memory tasks.As expected, online working memory accuracy was improved in the active bilateral DLPFC condition versus sham stimulation. Importantly, this working memory enhancement was related to post-stimulation self-evaluation scores.Theoretically, our findings indicated that cognitive-control representations (e.g., working memory accuracy) could serve as the optimal frame of reference for later retrospective metacognitive judgments.Noninvasive application of bi-frontal oscillatory currents might enhance functional connectivity between prefrontal regulatory components of working memory and retrospective monitoring in humans. Importantly, along with recent electrophysiological finding indicating interaction of tACS with ongoing oscillatory activity, our preliminary findings support the feasibility of utilizing tACS to treat theta-rhythm functional disconnectivity and related cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.},

Primary efficacy variables included changes from baseline in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, severity of illness score on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and total score and psychosis cluster score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).Significantly greater improvement in all primary efficacy variables was seen in the group receiving haloperidol than in the group receiving placebo at 6 weeks (endpoint analyses), indicating the validity of the study. The group receiving the NK(3) antagonist showed significantly greater improvement over baseline than the group receiving placebo as measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score, CGI severity of illness score, and BPRS psychosis cluster score. Reductions in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and negative scores in the group receiving the 5-HT(2A/2C) antagonist were significantly larger than those in the group receiving placebo. The improvements in psychopathology produced by the NK(3) and 5-HT(2A/2C) antagonists were smaller than those produced by haloperidol, although the response to the NK(3) antagonist was positively correlated with plasma levels. The groups receiving the CB(1) and NTS(1) antagonists did not differ from the group receiving placebo on any outcome measure. All investigational drugs were well tolerated.The novel design used in this study permitted the use of a smaller number of patients receiving placebo to test the efficacy of the four novel compounds. The NK(3) and 5-HT(2A/2C) antagonists showed evidence of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Study limitations preclude a definitive conclusion on the efficacy of CB(1) and NTS(1) antagonists in the treatment of schizophrenia. Further study of these two promising nondopaminergic mechanisms to treat schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder appears indicated.},

  abstract  = {Dopamine D2-like receptors play an important role in the pharmacotherapy of psychotic disorders. Molecular and cellular techniques have identified distinct gene products {(D2-long}, D2-short, D3 and D4) displaying the D2 receptor pharmacology. However, the contribution of each subtype in antipsychotic effects of or their physiological role remain unclear. Here we describe the pharmacological effects of a selective D4 antagonist, U-101387. U-101387 displayed moderately high affinity {(Ki} = 10 {nM)} and selectivity for the dopamine D4.2 receptor expressed in clonal cell lines. It lacked measurable affinity for not only other dopamine receptors but also noradrenalin, serotonin and histamine receptor families {(Ki} {\textgreater} 2000 {nM).} It fully and dose-dependently antagonized quinpirole-induced {cAMP} inhibition (without producing any effect by itself) in stably transfected cells. U-101387 also displayed excellent oral bioavailability, brain penetration and other pharmacokinetic characteristics. Unlike classical neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol), U-101387 neither blocked acute behavioral effects of amphetamine or apomorphine nor did it alter spontaneous locomotion by itself. Additionally, U-101387 was without effect in behavioral and biochemical tests predictive of extrapyramidal and neuroendocrine side effects. Consistent with the lack of autoreceptor function of D4, acute administration of U-101387 failed to alter dopamine neuronal firing by itself or reverse the inhibition produced by dopamine agonists and to affect monoamine turnover in areas innervated by the mesencephalic or hypothalamic dopamine neurons. However, U-101387 potently induced c-fos {mRNA} expression in the infralimbic/ventral prelimbic cortex to a level similar to that produced by the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine. This is consistent with the predominantly cortical distribution of the D4 receptor. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the D4-selective antagonist, U-101387, produces effects that are distinct from those of the nonselective D2 antagonists as well as D3-preferring agents. U-101387 offers a unique tool to understand the role of dopamine D4 receptors in diseases involving central dopamine systems.},

  abstract    = {Mutations in the K(V)7.2 gene encoding for voltage-dependent K(+) channel subunits cause neonatal epilepsies with wide phenotypic heterogeneity. Two mutations affecting the same positively charged residue in the S4 domain of K(V)7.2 have been found in children affected with benign familial neonatal seizures (R213W mutation) or with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy with severe pharmacoresistant seizures and neurocognitive delay, suppression-burst pattern at EEG, and distinct neuroradiological features (R213Q mutation). To examine the molecular basis for this strikingly different phenotype, we studied the functional characteristics of mutant channels by using electrophysiological techniques, computational modeling, and homology modeling. Functional studies revealed that, in homomeric or heteromeric configuration with K(V)7.2 and/or K(V)7.3 subunits, both mutations markedly destabilized the open state, causing a dramatic decrease in channel voltage sensitivity. These functional changes were (i) more pronounced for channels incorporating R213Q- than R213W-carrying K(V)7.2 subunits; (ii) proportional to the number of mutant subunits incorporated; and (iii) fully restored by the neuronal K(v)7 activator retigabine. Homology modeling confirmed a critical role for the R213 residue in stabilizing the activated voltage sensor configuration. Modeling experiments in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells revealed that both mutations increased cell firing frequency, with the R213Q mutation prompting more dramatic functional changes compared with the R213W mutation. These results suggest that the clinical disease severity may be related to the extent of the mutation-induced functional K(+) channel impairment, and set the preclinical basis for the potential use of K(v)7 openers as a targeted anticonvulsant therapy to improve developmental outcome in neonates with K(V)7.2 encephalopathy.},

  abstract    = {Stereology is a group of mathematical and statistical methods that allows the extrapolation of three-dimensional structural information from two-dimensional sections (or slices). This allows researchers to derive important quantitative structural information, such as the volume, surface area or numbers of particular particles (e.g. cells) within defined regional boundaries. The need for such quantitative information in biology is of particular importance when evaluating the influence of various experimental treatments on specific organs, tissues and cells in the body. Knowledge of such changes has given important insights into the neural substrates that may be responsible for the functional and behavioral consequences of a disparate range of experimental treatments. Here, we describe some of these methods as applied to quantifying the total numbers of cells in defined regions of the hippocampal formation. The methods used for this evaluation were, first, the Cavalieri principle, which was used to determine the volumes of the various subdivisions of the rat hippocampus, and, second, the 'physical disector' method, which was used to estimate the numerical density of neurons within each subdivision. Once these values were derived, it was but a simple task to multiply them together to obtain estimates for the total numbers of cells in the given hippocampal region. We found that 16-and 30-day-old normal male rats had 176 800 and 152 700 pyramidal cells in the CA1 region, respectively. This decrease in the neuronal number was statistically significant. However, in the CA2 + CA3 region, there were approximately 169 300 and 149 600 pyramidal cells in 16- and 30-day-old normal male rats, respectively, which was not significantly different. In the dentate gyrus, there were approximately 36 700 neurons in the hilus region and 483 000 granule cells in the granule cell layer, irrespective of the age of the rats. There were no significant differences between these estimates of hilus neurons and granule cells.},

  abstract    = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) is a second messenger that induces the release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R) was discovered as a developmentally regulated glyco-phosphoprotein, P400, that was missing in strains of mutant mice. IP(3)R can allosterically and dynamically change its form in a reversible manner. The crystal structures of the IP(3)-binding core and N-terminal suppressor sequence of IP(3)R have been identified. An IP(3) indicator (known as IP(3)R-based IP(3) sensor) was developed from the IP(3)-binding core. The IP(3)-binding core's affinity to IP(3) is very similar among the three isoforms of IP(3)R; instead, the N-terminal IP(3) binding suppressor region is responsible for isoform-specific IP(3)-binding affinity tuning. Various pathways for the trafficking of IP(3)R have been identified; for example, the ER forms a meshwork upon which IP(3)R moves by lateral diffusion, and vesicular ER subcompartments containing IP(3)R move rapidly along microtubles using a kinesin motor. Furthermore, IP(3)R mRNA within mRNA granules also moves along microtubules. IP(3)Rs are involved in exocrine secretion. ERp44 works as a redox sensor in the ER and regulates IP(3)R1 activity. IP(3) has been found to release Ca(2+), but it also releases IRBIT (IP(3)R-binding protein released with IP(3)). IRBIT is a pseudo-ligand for IP(3) that regulates the frequency and amplitude of Ca(2+) oscillations through IP(3)R. IRBIT binds to pancreas-type Na, bicarbonate co-transporter 1, which is important for acid-base balance. The presence of many kinds of binding partners, like homer, protein 4.1N, huntingtin-associated protein-1A, protein phosphatases (PPI and PP2A), RACK1, ankyrin, chromogranin, carbonic anhydrase-related protein, IRBIT, Na,K-ATPase, and ERp44, suggest that IP(3)Rs form a macro signal complex and function as a center for signaling cascades. The structure of IP(3)R1, as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy, fits closely with these molecules.},

  abstract   = {Glutamatergic transmission at mossy fiber {(MF)} synapses on {CA3} pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus is mediated by {AMPA}, kainate, and {NMDA} receptors and undergoes presynaptic modulation by metabotropic glutamate receptors. The recruitment of different receptors has thus far been studied by altering presynaptic stimulation to modulate glutamate release and interfering pharmacologically with receptors and transporters. Here, we introduce two novel experimental manipulations that alter the fate of glutamate molecules following release. First, an enzymatic glutamate scavenger reduces the postsynaptic response as well as presynaptic modulation by metabotropic receptors. At physiological temperature, however, the scavenger is effective only when glutamate uptake is blocked, revealing a role of active transport in both synaptic and extrasynaptic communication. Second, {AMPA} and kainate receptor–mediated postsynaptic signals are enhanced when extracellular diffusion is retarded by adding dextran to the perfusion solution, as is feedback modulation by metabotropic receptors, suggesting that the receptors are not saturated under baseline conditions. These results show that manipulating the spatiotemporal profile of glutamate following exocytosis can alter the involvement of different receptors in synaptic transmission.},

All reports used functional neuroimaging during executive function performance by adult patients with schizophrenia and reported whole-brain analyses in standard stereotactic space. Tasks primarily included the delayed match-to-sample, N-back, AX-CPT, and Stroop tasks.Activation likelihood estimation modeling reported activation maxima as the center of a 3-dimensional gaussian function in the meta-analysis, with statistical thresholding and correction for multiple comparisons.In within-group analyses, healthy controls and patients activated a similarly distributed cortical-subcortical network, prominently including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventrolateral PFC, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and thalamus. In between-group analyses, patients showed reduced activation in the left dorsolateral PFC, rostral/dorsal ACC, left thalamus (with significant co-occurrence of these areas), and inferior/posterior cortical areas. Increased activation was observed in several midline cortical areas. Activation within groups varied modestly by task.Healthy adults and schizophrenic patients activate a qualitatively similar neural network during executive task performance, consistent with the engagement of a general-purpose cognitive control network, with critical nodes in the dorsolateral PFC and ACC. Nevertheless, patients with schizophrenia show altered activity with deficits in the dorsolateral PFC, ACC, and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Increases in activity are evident in other PFC areas, which could be compensatory in nature.},

  abstract  = {Metabotropic glutamate receptors {(mGluRs)} found on synaptic terminals throughout the brain are thought to be important in modulating neurotransmission. Activation of {mGluRs} by synaptically released glutamate depresses glutamate release from excitatory terminals but the physiological role of {mGluRs} on inhibitory terminals is unclear. We have investigated activation of {mGluRs} on inhibitory terminals within the cerebellar glomerulus, a structure in which {GABA} (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing inhibitory terminals and glutamatergic excitatory terminals are in close apposition and make axo-dendritic synapses onto granule cells. Here we show that 'spillover' of glutamate, which is released from excitatory mossy fibres, inhibits {GABA} release from Golgi cell terminals by activating presynaptic {mGluRs} under physiological conditions. The magnitude of the depression of the inhibitory postsynaptic current is dependent on the frequency of mossy fibre stimulation, reaching 50\% at 100 Hz. Furthermore, the duration of inhibitory postsynaptic current depression mirrors the time course of mossy fibre activity. Our results establish that {mGluRs} on inhibitory interneuron axons sense the activity of neighbouring excitatory synapses. This heterosynaptic mechanism is likely to boost the efficacy of active excitatory fibres by locally reducing the level of inhibition.},

Group {II} metabotropic glutamate receptors were targeted to normalize glutamatergic disruptions associated with an animal model of schizophrenia, the phencyclidine model. An agonist of this group of receptors, at a dose that was without effects on spontaneous activity and corticolimbic dopamine neurotransmission, attenuated the disruptive effects of phencyclidine on working memory, stereotypy, locomotion, and cortical glutamate efflux. This behavioral reversal occurred in spite of sustained dopamine hyperactivity. Thus, targeting this group of receptors may present a nondopaminergic therapeutic strategy for treatment of psychiatric disorders.},

We began these efforts in the late 1980s with a keen sense that, in both human and animal studies, we needed to move beyond the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia; if the dopamine hypothesis were correct, the existing dopamine antagonists should have cured the disease but they have not. We used NMDA receptor antagonists, not to produce schizophrenia, but as a tool to provide insights into effects of disturbances in glutamate synaptic function in schizophrenia. Our work has provided insights into potential mechanisms that may contribute to disrupted cortical function in schizophrenia and has helped identify potential treatment targets for the disorder. The translational nature of this study made the clinical testing of the first of these targets feasible. Advances in systems neuroscience approaches in animals and humans make new types of translational research possible; however, our concern is that the current obstacles facing translational research funding and academia-industry collaborations threaten the future progress in this field.},

The exact neuroanatomical substrates underlying each effect of THC are, however, not known. We tested locomotor, hypothermic, analgesic, and cataleptic effects of THC in conditional knockout mouse lines, which lack the expression of CB1 in different neuronal subpopulations, including principal brain neurons, GABAergic neurons (those that release gamma aminobutyric acid), cortical glutamatergic neurons, and neurons expressing the dopamine receptor D1, respectively. Surprisingly, mice lacking CB1 in GABAergic neurons responded to THC similarly as wild-type littermates did, whereas deletion of the receptor in all principal neurons abolished or strongly reduced the behavioural and autonomic responses to the drug. Moreover, locomotor and hypothermic effects of THC depend on cortical glutamatergic neurons, whereas the deletion of CB1 from the majority of striatal neurons and a subpopulation of cortical glutamatergic neurons blocked the cataleptic effect of the drug. These data show that several important pharmacological actions of THC do not depend on functional expression of CB1 on GABAergic interneurons, but on other neuronal populations, and pave the way to a refined interpretation of the pharmacological effects of cannabinoids on neuronal functions.},

In the hippocampus, cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor is present on both GABAergic and glutamatergic axon terminals. CB1 receptor-deficient mice were previously shown to have increased hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In this study, we have investigated the consequences of cell-type-specific deletion of the CB1 receptor on the induction of hippocampal LTP and on CA1 pyramidal cell morphology. Deletion of CB1 receptor in GABAergic neurons in GABA-CB1-KO mice leads to a significantly decreased hippocampal LTP compared with WT controls. Concomitantly, CA1 pyramidal neurons have a significantly reduced dendritic branching both on the apical and on the basal dendrites. Moreover, the average spine density on the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons is significantly diminished. In contrast, in mice lacking CB1 receptor in glutamatergic cells (Glu-CB1-KO), hippocampal LTP is significantly enhanced and CA1 pyramidal neurons show an increased branching and an increased spine density in the apical dendritic region. Together, these results indicate that the CB1 receptor signaling system both on inhibitory and excitatory neurons controls functional and structural synaptic plasticity of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region to maintain an appropriate homeostatic state upon neuronal activation. Consequently, if the CB1 receptor is lost in either neuronal population, an allostatic shift will occur leading to a long-term dysregulation of neuronal functions.},

To analyze further the role of the 5-HT3R in the CNS, we used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to determine that 5-HT3R-expressing neurons are mainly GABA-containing cells in the rat telencephalon. We determined that 5-HT3R/GABA-containing neurons do not exhibit somatostatin immunoreactivity but often contain cholecystokinin (CCK) immunoreactivity. 5-HT3R-expressing cells with CCK immunoreactivity were observed in the neocortex, olfactory cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The 5-HT3R/CCK interneurons represent between 35 and 66\% of the total population of CCK-containing cells in the neocortex. Further characterization of the 5-HT3R/GABAergic neurons was based on their calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity and showed that these neurons lack parvalbumin (PV) and represent a subpopulation of calbindin (CB)-containing interneurons that were preferentially present in the CA1-CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. Although some 5-HT3R/GABAergic neurons with calretinin (CR) were found in the neocortex, olfactory cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, these neurons were more often present in the agranular insular and piriform cortices. We conclude that the neuronal expression of the 5-HT3R is selective within the GABA neuron population in the rat telencephalon. These 5-HT3R-expressing interneurons might contain CCK, CB, and CR. We suggest that serotonin through the 5-HT3R may regulate GABA and CCK neurotransmission in the telencephalon.},

  abstract    = {Systemic doses of the psychotomimetic ketamine alter the spectral characteristics of hippocampal and prefrontal cortical network activity. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of cross-spectral densities, we quantify the putative synaptic mechanisms underlying ketamine effects in terms of changes in directed, effective connectivity between dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal (dCA1-mPFC) cortex of freely moving rats. We parameterize dose-dependent changes in spectral signatures of dCA1-mPFC local field potential recordings, using neural mass models of glutamatergic and GABAergic circuits. Optimizing DCMs of theta and gamma frequency range responses, model comparisons suggest that both enhanced gamma and depressed theta power result from a reduction in top-down connectivity from mPFC to the hippocampus, mediated by postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). This is accompanied by an alteration in the bottom-up pathway from dCA1 to mPFC, which exhibits a distinct asymmetry: here, feed-forward drive at AMPA receptors increases in the presence of decreased NMDAR-mediated inputs. Setting these findings in the context of predictive coding suggests that NMDAR antagonism by ketamine in recurrent hierarchical networks may result in the failure of top-down connections from higher cortical regions to signal predictions to lower regions in the hierarchy, which consequently fail to respond consistently to errors. Given that NMDAR dysfunction has a central role in pathophysiological theories of schizophrenia and that theta and gamma rhythm abnormalities are evident in schizophrenic patients, the approach followed here may furnish a framework for the study of aberrant hierarchical message passing (of prediction errors) in schizophrenia-and the false perceptual inferences that ensue.Neuropsychopharmacology advance online publication, 20 August 2014; doi:10.1038/npp.2014.184.},

Evidence has been accumulating that TRPV1 is expressed also in the brain, where it seems to be involved in antinociception, locomotor control, and regulation of affective behaviors. This ion channel might be activated by arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide), the endogenous agonist of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB(1)) receptor. However, while CB(1) activation leads to a decrease in intracellular calcium and attenuation of synaptic transmission, anandamide binding to TRPV1 results in elevated calcium levels and potentiated synaptic transmission. This suggests a tripartite regulatory system with antagonistic effects of CB(1) and TRPV1, which are tied together by the same endogenous ligand. Such a system may have important implication for the modulation of behavioral responses. The present commentary elaborates on this interplay between CB(1) receptors and TRPV1 channels in the context of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoids modulate inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission in many brain regions. Within the temporal lobe, cannabinoid receptors are highly expressed, and are located presynaptically at inhibitory terminals. Here, we have explored the role of type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) at the level of inhibitory synaptic currents and field-recorded network oscillations. We report that arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA; 10 microM), an agonist at CB1R, inhibits GABAergic synaptic transmission onto both superficial and deep medial entorhinal (mEC) neurones, but this has little effect on network oscillations in beta/gamma frequency bands. By contrast, the CB1R antagonist/inverse agonist LY320135 (500 nM), increased GABAergic synaptic activity and beta/gamma oscillatory activity in superficial mEC, was suppressed, whilst that in deep mEC was enhanced. These data indicate that cannabinoid-mediated effects on inhibitory synaptic activity may be constitutively active in vitro, and that modulation of CB1R activation using inverse agonists unmasks complex effects of CBR function on network activity.},

  abstract    = {The main ingredient in cannabis, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can elicit acute psychotic reactions in healthy individuals and precipitate relapse in schizophrenic patients. However, the neural mechanism of this is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that THC psychopathology is related to changes in electroencephalography (EEG) power or inter-regional coherence. In a within-subjects design, participants (n=16) were given intravenous THC (1.25 mg) or placebo under double-blind conditions, during EEG recordings. Using fast-Fourier transform, EEG data were analyzed for power and coherence in the delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (3.5-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (14-25 Hz), low-gamma (30-40 Hz), and high-gamma (60-70 Hz) bands during engagement in the n-back test of working memory (WM). Compared with placebo, THC evoked positive and negative psychotic symptoms, as measured by the positive and negative syndrome scale (p<0.001) and slowed WM performance (p<0.05). Under THC, theta power was specifically reduced, (p<0.001) regardless of WM load; however, the reduction showed no relationship with psychotic symptoms or WM impairment. Coherence between bi-frontal electrodes in the theta band was also reduced by THC (p<0.05) and these reductions correlated with the change-in positive psychotic symptoms (rho=0.79, p<0.001). Bi-frontal specificity was suggested by the absence of a relationship between psychotic symptoms and fronto-parietal coherence. The results reveal that the pro-psychotic effects of THC might be related to impaired network dynamics with impaired communication between the right and left frontal lobes.},

  abstract    = {Recent work suggests that heavy use of cannabis is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia-like psychosis. However, there is a dearth of experimental studies of the effects of the constituents of cannabis, such as Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In a study of intravenous (i.v.) synthetic THC in healthy humans, we aimed to study the relationship of the psychotic symptoms induced by THC to the consequent anxiety and neuropsychological impairment.Twenty-two healthy adult males aged 28+/-6 years (mean+/-s.d.) participated in experimental sessions in which i.v. THC (2.5 mg) was administered under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. Self-rated and investigator-rated measurements of mood and psychosis [the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist (UMACL), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE)] were made at baseline and at 30, 80 and 120 min post-injection. Participants also completed a series of neuropsychological tests [the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT), Digit Span, Verbal Fluency and the Baddeley Reasoning Task] within 45 min of injection.THC-induced positive psychotic symptoms, and participant- and investigator-rated measurements of these were highly correlated. Participants showed an increase in anxiety ratings but there was no relationship between either self- or investigator-rated positive psychotic symptoms and anxiety. THC also impaired neuropsychological performance but once again there was no relationship between THC-induced positive psychotic symptoms and deficits in working memory/executive function.These findings confirm that THC can induce a transient, acute psychotic reaction in psychiatrically well individuals. The extent of the psychotic reaction was not related to the degree of anxiety or cognitive impairment.},

  abstract    = {We modeled the neuronal circuits that may underlie a sensory-processing deficit associated with schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients have small P50 auditory-evoked responses to click stimuli compared to normal subjects. The P50 auditory-evoked response is a positive waveform recorded in the EEG approximately 50 ms after the auditory click stimulus. In addition to relatively small amplitudes, schizophrenic patients do not gate or suppress the P50 auditory-evoked response to the second of two paired-click stimuli spaced 0.5 s apart. Neuropleptic medication, which decreases dopaminergic neuronal transmission, increases the amplitude of the P50 auditory-evoked response but does not improve gating. Normal subjects have large P50 auditory-evoked responses to click stimuli when compared to unmedicated schizophrenic patients, and they gate their response to paired click stimuli or have smaller P50 auditory-evoked response amplitudes to the second of two click stimuli spaced 0.5 s apart. Schizophrenic patients do not gate and have similar response amplitudes to both clicks. We hypothesized that the small amplitudes of unmedicated schizophrenic subjects were due to a state of occlusion whereby excessive background noise in local circuits reduced the ability of cells to respond synchronously to sensory input, thereby reducing the amplitude of the P50 waveform in the EEG. Because the P50 auditory-evoked potential amplitudes increased with neuroleptic medication, which reduces dopaminergic neuronal transmission, we hypothesized a role for dopamine in modulating the signal-to-noise (S/N) in the local circuits responsible for sensory gating. To test the hypothesis that modulation of the S/N ratio reduces sensory gating, we developed a model of the effects of dopaminergic neuronal transmission that modulates the S/N in neuronal circuits. The model uses the biologically relevant computer model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus developed in the companion paper [Moxon et al. (2003) Biol Cybern, this volume]. Modified Hebb cell assemblies represented the response of the network to the click stimulus. The results of our model showed that excessive dopaminergic input impaired the ability of cells to respond synchronously to sensory input, which reduced the amplitudes of the P50 evoked responses.},

Normal subjects have a reduced P50 auditory-evoked potential amplitude in response to the second of two paired auditory click stimuli spaced 0.5 s apart. However, schizophrenic patients do not gate or reduce their response to the second click. They have equal auditory-evoked response amplitudes to both clicks. When schizophrenic patients were medicated with traditional neuroleptics, the evoked potential amplitude to both clicks increased, but gating of the second response was not restored or improved. Animal studies suggest a role for septohippocampal cholinergic activity in sensory gating. We used a computational model of this system in order to study the relative contributions of local processing and afferent activity in sensory gating. We first compared the effect of information representation as average firing rate to information representation as cell assemblies in order to evaluate the best method to represent the response of hippocampal neurons to the auditory click. We then studied the effects of nicotinic cholinergic input on the response of the network and the effect of GABA(B) receptor activation on the ability of the local network to suppress the test response. The results of our model showed that nicotinic cholinergic input from the septum to the hippocampus can control the flow of sensory information from the cortex into the hippocampus. In addition, postsynaptic GABA(B) receptor activation was not sufficient to suppress the test response when the interstimulus interval was 500 ms. However, presynaptic GABA(B) receptor activity may be responsible for the suppression of the test response at this interstimulus interval.},

Although dopaminergic denervation produces changes in the expression and supersensitization of these receptors, the consequences of these changes on GABAergic neurotransmission are unknown. The aim of this study was to show the effects of CB1R and D2R activation and coactivation on the uptake and release of [(3) H]GABA in the globus pallidus of hemiparkinsonian rats as well as their effects on motor behavior. The activation of CB1R blocked GABA uptake and decreased GABA release in the globus pallidus in the dopamine denervated side, whereas the co-activation of CB1R-D2R increased GABA release and had no effect on GABA uptake. A microinjection of the CB1R agonist ACEA into the globus pallidus ipsilaterally to a 6-OHDA lesion potentiated turning behavior that was induced by methamphetamine. However, a microinjection of the D2R agonist quinpirole did not modify this behavior, and a microinjection of a mixture of CB1R and D2R agonists significantly potentiated turning behavior. The behavioral effects produced after the activation of the CB1R and the co-activation of CB1R and D2R can be explained by increased GABAergic neurotransmission produced by a block of GABA uptake and an increase in the release of GABA in the globus pallidus, respectively.},

  abstract    = {Presynaptic Ca2+ signaling plays a crucial role in short-term plasticity of synaptic transmission. Here, we studied the role of mobile endogenous presynaptic Ca2+ buffer(s) in modulating paired-pulse facilitation at a large excitatory nerve terminal in the auditory brainstem, the calyx of Held. To do so, we assessed the effect of presynaptic whole-cell recording, which should lead to the diffusional loss of endogenous mobile Ca2+ buffers, on paired-pulse facilitation and on intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients evoked by action potentials. In unperturbed calyces briefly preloaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-6F, the [Ca2+]i transient decayed surprisingly fast (tau(fast), approximately 30 ms). Presynaptic whole-cell recordings made without additional Ca2+ buffers slowed the decay kinetics of [Ca2+]i and paired-pulse facilitation (twofold to threefold), but the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient was changed only marginally. The fast [Ca2+]i decay was restored by adding the slow Ca2+ buffer EGTA (50-100 microM) or parvalbumin (100 microM), a Ca2+-binding protein with slow Ca2+-binding kinetics, to the presynaptic pipette solution. In contrast, the fast Ca2+ buffer fura-2 strongly reduced the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and slowed its decay, suggesting that the mobile endogenous buffer in calyces of Held has slow, rather than fast, binding kinetics. In parvalbumin knock-out mice, the decay of [Ca2+]i and facilitation was slowed approximately twofold compared with wild-type mice, similar to what is observed during whole-cell recordings in rat calyces of Held. Thus, in young calyces of Held, a mobile Ca2+ buffer with slow binding kinetics, primarily represented by parvalbumin, accelerates the decay of spatially averaged [Ca2+]i and paired-pulse facilitation.},

  abstract    = {Excitation-inhibition balance (E/I balance) is a fundamental property of cortical microcircuitry. Disruption of E/I balance in prefrontal cortex is hypothesized to underlie cognitive deficits observed in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. To elucidate the link between these phenomena, we incorporated synaptic disinhibition, via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor perturbation on interneurons, into a network model of spatial working memory (WM). At the neural level, disinhibition broadens the tuning of WM-related, stimulus-selective persistent activity patterns. The model predicts that this change at the neural level leads to 2 primary behavioral deficits: 1) increased behavioral variability that degrades the precision of stored information and 2) decreased ability to filter out distractors during WM maintenance. We specifically tested the main model prediction, broadened WM representation under disinhibition, using behavioral data from human subjects performing a spatial WM task combined with ketamine infusion, a pharmacological model of schizophrenia hypothesized to induce disinhibition. Ketamine increased errors in a pattern predicted by the model. Finally, as proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that WM deteriorations in the model can be ameliorated by compensations that restore E/I balance. Our findings identify specific ways by which cortical disinhibition affects WM, suggesting new experimental designs for probing the brain mechanisms of WM deficits in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Behavioral and electrophysiological human ketamine models of schizophrenia are used for testing compounds that target the glutamatergic system. However, corresponding functional neuroimaging models are difficult to reconcile with functional imaging and electrophysiological findings in schizophrenia. Resolving the discrepancies between different observational levels is critical to understand the complex pharmacological ketamine action and its usefulness for modeling schizophrenia pathophysiology.We conducted a within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacoimaging study in twenty-four male volunteers. Subjects were given low-dose S-ketamine (bolus prior to functional imaging: 0.1mg/kg during 5min, thereafter continuous infusion: 0.015625mg/kg/min reduced by 10\% every ten minutes) or placebo while performing a visual oddball task during simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with continuous recording of event-related potentials (P300) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Before and after intervention, psychopathological status was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale.P300 amplitude and corresponding BOLD responses were diminished in the ketamine condition in cortical regions being involved in sensory processing/selective attention. In both measurement modalities separation of drug conditions was achieved with area under the curve (AUC) values of up to 0.8-0.9. Ketamine effects were also observed in the clinical, behavioral and peripheral physiological domains (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, reaction hit and false alarm rate, electrodermal activity and heart rate) which were in part related to the P300/fMRI measures.The findings from our ketamine experiment are consistent across modalities and directly related to observations in schizophrenia supporting the validity of the model. Our investigation provides the first prototypic example of a pharmacoimaging study using simultaneously acquired fMRI/EEG.},

  abstract    = {We investigated the effect of a synthetic cannabinoid, WIN 55,212-2 on excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals in CA1 pyramidal cells. Bath application of WIN 55,212-2 reduced the amplitude of EPSCs in dose-dependent manner tested between 0.01 nM and 30 microM. In rats and mice, this cannabinoid ligand inhibited excitatory synapses in two steps at the nM and muM concentrations. When the function of CB(1) cannabinoid receptors (CB(1)R) was impaired, either by the application of a CB(1)R antagonist AM251, or by using CB(1)R knockout mice, WIN 55,212-2 in microM concentrations could still significantly reduced the amplitude of EPSCs. WIN 55,212-2 likely affected the efficacy of excitatory transmission only at presynaptic sites, since both at low and high doses the paired pulse ratio of EPSC amplitude was significantly increased. The inactive enantiomer, WIN 55,212-3, mimicked the effect of WIN 55,212-2 applied in high doses. In further experiments we found that the CB(1)R-independent effect of 10 microM WIN 55,212-2 at glutamatergic synapses was fully abolished, when slices were pre-treated with omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not with omega-agatoxin IVA. These data suggest that, in the hippocampus, WIN 55,212-2 reduces glutamate release from Schaffer collaterals solely via CB(1)Rs in the nM concentration range, whereas in microM concentrations, WIN 55,212-2 suppresses excitatory transmission, in addition to activation of CB(1)Rs, by directly blocking N-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels independent of CB(1)Rs.},

It is also known that the originally proposed trisynaptic circuit is a simplified representation of the organization of this system. In this paper, we present evidence, both anatomically and electrophysiologically, for the existence of direct and indirect parallel pathways through the hippocampal memory system arising from the perirhinal and postrhinal cortex. These pathways form nested loops. The subiculum occupies a central position within these loops. In the subiculum, both "raw" and highly processed information will converge. Therefore, we propose that the subiculum occupies a pivotal position in the hippocampal memory system, both as recipient and comparator of signals and as a distributor of processed information.},

  abstract    = {Neuronal electrical oscillations in the theta (4-14 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) ranges are necessary for the performance of certain animal behaviours and cognitive processes. Perisomatic GABAergic inhibition is prominently involved in cortical oscillations driven by ACh release from septal cholinergic afferents. In neocortex and hippocampal CA3 regions, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells, activated by ACh and glutamatergic agonists, largely mediate oscillations. However, in CA1 hippocampus in vitro, cholinergic agonists or the optogenetic release of endogenous ACh from septal afferents induces rhythmic, theta-frequency inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in pyramidal cells, even with glutamatergic transmission blocked. The IPSCs are regulated by exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids, suggesting that they arise from type 1 cannabinoid receptor-expressing (CB1R+) interneurons - mainly cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing cells. Nevertheless, an occult contribution of PV-expressing interneurons to these rhythms remained conceivable. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by selectively silencing CA1 PV-expressing cells optogenetically with halorhodopsin or archaerhodopsin. However, this had no effect on theta-frequency IPSC rhythms induced by carbachol (CCh). In contrast, the silencing of glutamic acid decarboxylase 2-positive interneurons, which include the CCK-expressing basket cells, strongly suppressed inhibitory oscillations; PV-expressing interneurons appear to play no role. The low-frequency IPSC oscillations induced by CCh or optogenetically stimulated ACh release were also inhibited by a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, which was unexpected because MORs in CA1 are not usually associated with CCK-expressing cells. Our results reveal novel properties of an inhibitory oscillator circuit within CA1 that is activated by muscarinic agonists. The oscillations could contribute to behaviourally relevant, atropine-sensitive, theta rhythms and link cannabinoid and opioid actions functionally.},

  abstract    = {Ketamine, a pan-NMDA receptor channel blocker, and CP-101,606, an NR2B-selective negative allosteric modulator, have antidepressant effects in humans that develop rapidly after the drugs are cleared from the body. It has been proposed that the antidepressant effect of ketamine results from delayed synaptic potentiation. To further investigate this hypothesis and potential mechanistic underpinnings we compared the effects of ketamine and CP-101,606 on neurophysiological biomarkers in rats immediately after drug administration and after the drugs had been eliminated. Local field and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded from primary auditory cortex and hippocampus in freely-moving rats. Effects of different doses of ketamine or CP-101,606 were evaluated on amplitude of AEPs, auditory gating, and absolute power of delta and gamma oscillations 5 to 30 min (Drug-On) and 5 to 6 h (Drug-Off) after systemic administration. Both ketamine and CP-101,606 significantly enhanced AEPs in cortex and hippocampus in the Drug-Off phase. In contrast, ketamine but not CP-101,606 disrupted auditory gating and increased gamma band power during the Drug-On period. While both drugs affected delta power, these did not correlate with increase in AEPs in the Drug-Off phase. Our findings show that both ketamine and CP-101,606 augment AEPs after drug elimination, consistent with synaptic potentiation as a mechanism for antidepressant efficacy. However, these drugs had different acute effects on neurophysiological parameters. These results have implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms for the rapid onset antidepressant effects of NMDA receptor inhibition and for the use of electrophysiological measures as translatable biomarkers.Neuropsychopharmacology accepted article preview online, 25 September 2015. doi:10.1038/npp.2015.298.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillatory abnormalities in SZ and PBP probands are heritable and expressed in their relatives, but the neurobiology and genetic factors mediating these abnormalities in the psychosis dimension of either disorder are less explored. We examined the polygenic architecture of eyes-open resting state EEG frequency activity (intrinsic frequency) from 64 channels in 105 SZ, 145 PBP probands and 56 healthy controls (HCs) from the multisite BSNIP (Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes) study. One million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were derived from DNA. We assessed eight data-driven EEG frequency activity derived from group-independent component analysis (ICA) in conjunction with a reduced subset of 10 422 SNPs through novel multivariate association using parallel ICA (para-ICA). Genes contributing to the association were examined collectively using pathway analysis tools. Para-ICA extracted five frequency and nine SNP components, of which theta and delta activities were significantly correlated with two different gene components, comprising genes participating extensively in brain development, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Delta and theta abnormality was present in both SZ and PBP, while theta differed between the two disorders. Theta abnormalities were also mediated by gene clusters involved in glutamic acid pathways, cadherin and synaptic contact-based cell adhesion processes. Our data suggest plausible multifactorial genetic networks, including novel and several previously identified (DISC1) candidate risk genes, mediating low frequency delta and theta abnormalities in psychoses. The gene clusters were enriched for biological properties affecting neural circuitry and involved in brain function and/or development.},

Transmitter release is initiated by quite high concentrations within microdomains, while short-term facilitation is strongly influenced by the global buildup of "residual calcium." A global rise in [Ca(2+)] also accelerates the recruitment of release-ready vesicles, thereby controlling the degree of short-term depression (STD) during sustained activity, as well as the recovery of the vesicle pool in periods of rest. We survey data that lead us to propose two distinct roles of [Ca(2+)] in vesicle recruitment: one accelerating "molecular priming" (vesicle docking and the buildup of a release machinery), the other promoting the tight coupling between releasable vesicles and Ca(2+) channels. Such coupling is essential for rendering vesicles sensitive to short [Ca(2+)] transients, generated during action potentials.},

Two groups of animals displaying low and high exploratory activity in the elevated plus-maze were selected for gene expression studies from the population of 43 male Wistar rats. Eight rats were taken randomly from the same cages as animals exposed to the plus-maze, but they were not subjected to the exploratory test. This home-cage control group was also used for gene expression analysis in order to explore a possible impact of the plus-maze exposure. Rats with low and high exploratory activity displayed clearly distinct profiles in gene expression. Most prominent alterations were established in the amygdala where almost all GABA-related and CCK receptor genes were two- to five-fold up-regulated in low exploratory activity rats compared to high exploratory activity and home-cage control group. The expression of several GABA-related genes was also increased in the PAG of animals displaying low exploratory activity compared to the other groups. Moreover, we found reduced expression of GABA- and CCK-related genes in all three brain regions in animals with high exploratory activity compared to the home-cage control group. In addition to these findings, we established a significantly increased expression of the LsAMP gene in the amygdala and PAG of low exploratory activity animals compared with the other groups. In conclusion, low and high exploratory activity rats differed not only by their exploratory activity but also displayed opposite gene expression patterns. Low exploratory activity of rats correlated with the up-regulation of LsAMP and GABA-related genes in the amygdala and PAG and with the up-regulation of CCK receptors in the amygdala. High exploratory activity of rats was related to a significant down-regulation of CCK receptor genes in the amygdala and PAG. These rats also displayed the reduced expression of GABA-related genes in the frontal cortex and PAG.},

  abstract    = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric disorders have identified multiple genetic associations with such disorders, but better methods are needed to derive the underlying biological mechanisms that these signals indicate. We sought to identify biological pathways in GWAS data from over 60,000 participants from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We developed an analysis framework to rank pathways that requires only summary statistics. We combined this score across disorders to find common pathways across three adult psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Histone methylation processes showed the strongest association, and we also found statistically significant evidence for associations with multiple immune and neuronal signaling pathways and with the postsynaptic density. Our study indicates that risk variants for psychiatric disorders aggregate in particular biological pathways and that these pathways are frequently shared between disorders. Our results confirm known mechanisms and suggest several novel insights into the etiology of psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract    = {Endocannabinoids and their attending cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor have been implicated in animal models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, their specific role has not been studied in people with PTSD. Herein, we present an in vivo imaging study using positron emission tomography (PET) and the CB1-selective radioligand [(11)C]OMAR in individuals with PTSD, and healthy controls with lifetime histories of trauma (trauma-exposed controls (TC)) and those without such histories (healthy controls (HC)). Untreated individuals with PTSD (N=25) with non-combat trauma histories, and TC (N=12) and HC (N=23) participated in a magnetic resonance imaging scan and a resting PET scan with the CB1 receptor antagonist radiotracer [(11)C]OMAR, which measures the volume of distribution (VT) linearly related to CB1 receptor availability. Peripheral levels of anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide and cortisol were also assessed. In the PTSD group, relative to the HC and TC groups, we found elevated brain-wide [(11)C]OMAR VT values (F(2,53)=7.96, P=0.001; 19.5\% and 14.5\% higher, respectively), which were most pronounced in women (F(1,53)=5.52, P=0.023). Anandamide concentrations were reduced in the PTSD relative to the TC (53.1\% lower) and HC (58.2\% lower) groups. Cortisol levels were lower in the PTSD and TC groups relative to the HC group. Three biomarkers examined collectively--OMAR VT, anandamide and cortisol--correctly classified nearly 85\% of PTSD cases. These results suggest that abnormal CB1 receptor-mediated anandamide signaling is implicated in the etiology of PTSD, and provide a promising neurobiological model to develop novel, evidence-based pharmacotherapies for this disorder.},

  abstract    = {Understanding the direction and quantity of information flowing in neuronal networks is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Brains and neuronal networks must at the same time store information about the world and react to information in the world. We sought to measure how the activity of the network alters information flow from inputs to output patterns. Using neocortical column neuronal network simulations, we demonstrated that networks with greater internal connectivity reduced input/output correlations from excitatory synapses and decreased negative correlations from inhibitory synapses, measured by Kendall's τ correlation. Both of these changes were associated with reduction in information flow, measured by normalized transfer entropy (nTE). Information handling by the network reflected the degree of internal connectivity. With no internal connectivity, the feedforward network transformed inputs through nonlinear summation and thresholding. With greater connectivity strength, the recurrent network translated activity and information due to contribution of activity from intrinsic network dynamics. This dynamic contribution amounts to added information drawn from that stored in the network. At still higher internal synaptic strength, the network corrupted the external information, producing a state where little external information came through. The association of increased information retrieved from the network with increased gamma power supports the notion of gamma oscillations playing a role in information processing.},

  abstract    = {Abnormalities in oscillations have been suggested to play a role in schizophrenia. We studied theta-modulated gamma oscillations in a computer model of hippocampal CA3 in vivo with and without simulated application of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist and psychotomimetic. Networks of 1200 multicompartment neurons [pyramidal, basket, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells] generated theta and gamma oscillations from intrinsic network dynamics: basket cells primarily generated gamma and amplified theta, while OLM cells strongly contributed to theta. Extrinsic medial septal inputs paced theta and amplified both theta and gamma oscillations. Exploration of NMDA receptor reduction across all location combinations demonstrated that the experimentally observed ketamine effect occurred only with isolated reduction of NMDA receptors on OLMs. In the ketamine simulations, lower OLM activity reduced theta power and disinhibited pyramidal cells, resulting in increased basket cell activation and gamma power. Our simulations predict the following: (1) ketamine increases firing rates; (2) oscillations can be generated by intrinsic hippocampal circuits; (3) medial-septum inputs pace and augment oscillations; (4) pyramidal cells lead basket cells at the gamma peak but lag at trough; (5) basket cells amplify theta rhythms; (6) ketamine alters oscillations due to primary blockade at OLM NMDA receptors; (7) ketamine alters phase relationships of cell firing; (8) ketamine reduces network responsivity to the environment; (9) ketamine effect could be reversed by providing a continuous inward current to OLM cells. We suggest that this last prediction has implications for a possible novel treatment for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by targeting OLM cells.},

  abstract    = {Coordination of neocortical oscillations has been hypothesized to underlie the "binding" essential to cognitive function. However, the mechanisms that generate neocortical oscillations in physiological frequency bands remain unknown. We hypothesized that interlaminar relations in neocortex would provide multiple intermediate loops that would play particular roles in generating oscillations, adding different dynamics to the network. We simulated networks from sensory neocortex using nine columns of event-driven rule-based neurons wired according to anatomical data and driven with random white-noise synaptic inputs. We tuned the network to achieve realistic cell firing rates and to avoid population spikes. A physiological frequency spectrum appeared as an emergent property, displaying dominant frequencies that were not present in the inputs or in the intrinsic or activated frequencies of any of the cell groups. We monitored spectral changes while using minimal dynamical perturbation as a methodology through gradual introduction of hubs into individual layers. We found that hubs in layer 2/3 excitatory cells had the greatest influence on overall network activity, suggesting that this subpopulation was a primary generator of theta/beta strength in the network. Similarly, layer 2/3 interneurons appeared largely responsible for gamma activation through preferential attenuation of the rest of the spectrum. The network showed evidence of frequency homeostasis: increased activation of supragranular layers increased firing rates in the network without altering the spectral profile, and alteration in synaptic delays did not significantly shift spectral peaks. Direct comparison of the power spectra with experimentally recorded local field potentials from prefrontal cortex of awake rat showed substantial similarities, including comparable patterns of cross-frequency coupling.},

  abstract    = {Neuronal persistent activity has been primarily assessed in terms of electrical mechanisms, without attention to the complex array of molecular events that also control cell excitability. We developed a multiscale neocortical model proceeding from the molecular to the network level to assess the contributions of calcium (Ca(2+)) regulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in providing additional and complementary support of continuing activation in the network. The network contained 776 compartmental neurons arranged in the cortical layers, connected using synapses containing AMPA/NMDA/GABAA/GABAB receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) produced inositol triphosphate (IP3) which caused the release of Ca(2+) from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, with reuptake by sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATP-ase pumps (SERCA), and influence on HCN channels. Stimulus-induced depolarization led to Ca(2+) influx via NMDA and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs). After a delay, mGluR activation led to ER Ca(2+) release via IP3 receptors. These factors increased HCN channel conductance and produced firing lasting for ∼1min. The model displayed inter-scale synergies among synaptic weights, excitation/inhibition balance, firing rates, membrane depolarization, Ca(2+) levels, regulation of HCN channels, and induction of persistent activity. The interaction between inhibition and Ca(2+) at the HCN channel nexus determined a limited range of inhibition strengths for which intracellular Ca(2+) could prepare population-specific persistent activity. Interactions between metabotropic and ionotropic inputs to the neuron demonstrated how multiple pathways could contribute in a complementary manner to persistent activity. Such redundancy and complementarity via multiple pathways is a critical feature of biological systems. Mediation of activation at different time scales, and through different pathways, would be expected to protect against disruption, in this case providing stability for persistent activity.},

  abstract    = {Calcium (Ca²⁺) waves provide a complement to neuronal electrical signaling, forming a key part of a neuron's second messenger system. We developed a reaction-diffusion model of an apical dendrite with diffusible inositol triphosphate (IP₃), diffusible Ca²⁺, IP₃ receptors (IP₃Rs), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca²⁺ leak, and ER pump (SERCA) on ER. Ca²⁺ is released from ER stores via IP₃Rs upon binding of IP₃ and Ca²⁺. This results in Ca²⁺-induced-Ca²⁺-release (CICR) and increases Ca²⁺ spread. At least two modes of Ca²⁺ wave spread have been suggested: a continuous mode based on presumed relative homogeneity of ER within the cell and a pseudo-saltatory model where Ca²⁺ regeneration occurs at discrete points with diffusion between them. We compared the effects of three patterns of hypothesized IP₃R distribution: (1) continuous homogeneous ER, (2) hotspots with increased IP₃R density (IP₃R hotspots), and (3) areas of increased ER density (ER stacks). All three modes produced Ca²⁺ waves with velocities similar to those measured in vitro (approximately 50-90 μm /sec). Continuous ER showed high sensitivity to IP₃R density increases, with time to onset reduced and speed increased. Increases in SERCA density resulted in opposite effects. The measures were sensitive to changes in density and spacing of IP₃R hotspots and stacks. Increasing the apparent diffusion coefficient of Ca²⁺ substantially increased wave speed. An extended electrochemical model, including voltage-gated calcium channels and AMPA synapses, demonstrated that membrane priming via AMPA stimulation enhances subsequent Ca²⁺ wave amplitude and duration. Our modeling suggests that pharmacological targeting of IP₃Rs and SERCA could allow modulation of Ca²⁺ wave propagation in diseases where Ca²⁺ dysregulation has been implicated.},

  abstract    = {We investigated the variation in neuropsychological function explained by risk alleles at the psychosis susceptibility gene ZNF804A and its interacting partners using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), polygenic scores, and epistatic analyses. Of particular importance was the relative contribution of the polygenic score vs epistasis in variation explained.To (1) assess the association between SNPs in ZNF804A and the ZNF804A polygenic score with measures of cognition in cases with psychosis and (2) assess whether epistasis within the ZNF804A pathway could explain additional variation above and beyond that explained by the polygenic score.Patients with psychosis (n = 424) were assessed in areas of cognitive ability impaired in schizophrenia including IQ, memory, attention, and social cognition. We used the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium 1 schizophrenia genome-wide association study to calculate a polygenic score based on identified risk variants within this genetic pathway. Cognitive measures significantly associated with the polygenic score were tested for an epistatic component using a training set (n = 170), which was used to develop linear regression models containing the polygenic score and 2-SNP interactions. The best-fitting models were tested for replication in 2 independent test sets of cases: (1) 170 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and (2) 84 patients with broad psychosis (including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and other psychosis).Participants completed a neuropsychological assessment battery designed to target the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia including general cognitive function, episodic memory, working memory, attentional control, and social cognition.Higher polygenic scores were associated with poorer performance among patients on IQ, memory, and social cognition, explaining 1\% to 3\% of variation on these scores (range, P = .01 to .03). Using a narrow psychosis training set and independent test sets of narrow phenotype psychosis (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder), broad psychosis, and control participants (n = 89), the addition of 2 interaction terms containing 2 SNPs each increased the R2 for spatial working memory strategy in the independent psychosis test sets from 1.2\% using the polygenic score only to 4.8\% (P = .11 and .001, respectively) but did not explain additional variation in control participants.These data support a role for the ZNF804A pathway in IQ, memory, and social cognition in cases. Furthermore, we showed that epistasis increases the variation explained above the contribution of the polygenic score.},

  abstract  = {We have identified a novel glutamate receptor subunit on the human and mouse genome. Cloning of the mouse {cDNA} revealed a protein consisting of 1003 amino acids encoded by at least nine exons. This protein showed the highest similarity (51\%) to the {NR3A} subunit of the {NMDA} receptor and therefore was termed {NR3B.} {NR3B} has a structure typical of glutamate receptor family members with a signal peptide and four membrane-associated regions. Amino acids forming a ligand-binding pocket are conserved. When coexpressed with {NR1} and {NR2A} in heterologous cells, {NR3B} suppressed glutamate-induced current similarly to {NR3A.} Thus members of the {NR3} class of {NMDA} receptors act as dominant-negative subunits in the {NMDA} receptor complex. {NR3B} shows very restricted expression in somatic motoneurons of the brainstem and spinal cord. Its expression in other types of motoneurons, including autonomic motoneurons in Onuf's nucleus and oculomotor neurons, is significantly weaker. Our results indicate that {NR3B} is important as a regulatory subunit that controls {NMDA} receptor transmission in motoneurons. It may be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases involving motoneurons as well.},

  abstract    = {Progress in science depends on the effective exchange of ideas among scientists. New ideas can be assessed and criticized in a meaningful manner only if they are formulated precisely. This applies to simulation studies as well as to experiments and theories. But after more than 50 years of neuronal network simulations, we still lack a clear and common understanding of the role of computational models in neuroscience as well as established practices for describing network models in publications. This hinders the critical evaluation of network models as well as their re-use. We analyze here 14 research papers proposing neuronal network models of different complexity and find widely varying approaches to model descriptions, with regard to both the means of description and the ordering and placement of material. We further observe great variation in the graphical representation of networks and the notation used in equations. Based on our observations, we propose a good model description practice, composed of guidelines for the organization of publications, a checklist for model descriptions, templates for tables presenting model structure, and guidelines for diagrams of networks. The main purpose of this good practice is to trigger a debate about the communication of neuronal network models in a manner comprehensible to humans, as opposed to machine-readable model description languages. We believe that the good model description practice proposed here, together with a number of other recent initiatives on data-, model-, and software-sharing, may lead to a deeper and more fruitful exchange of ideas among computational neuroscientists in years to come. We further hope that work on standardized ways of describing--and thinking about--complex neuronal networks will lead the scientific community to a clearer understanding of high-level concepts in network dynamics, and will thus lead to deeper insights into the function of the brain.},

  abstract    = {An acute challenge with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can induce psychotic symptoms including delusions. High electroencephalography (EEG) frequencies, above 20 Hz, have previously been implicated in psychosis and schizophrenia.The objective of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous THC compared to placebo on high-frequency EEG.A double-blind cross-over study design was used. In the resting state, the high-beta to low-gamma magnitude (21-45 Hz) was investigated (n = 13 pairs + 4 THC only). Also, the event-related synchronisation (ERS) of motor-associated high gamma was studied using a self-paced button press task (n = 15).In the resting state, there was a significant condition × frequency interaction (p = 0.00017), consisting of a shift towards higher frequencies under THC conditions (reduced high beta [21-27 Hz] and increased low gamma [27-45 Hz]). There was also a condition × frequency × location interaction (p = 0.006), such that the reduction in 21-27-Hz magnitude tended to be more prominent in anterior regions, whilst posterior areas tended to show greater 27-45-Hz increases. This effect was correlated with positive symptoms, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (r = 0.429, p = 0.042). In the motor task, there was a main effect of THC to increase 65-130-Hz ERS (p = 0.035) over contra-lateral sensorimotor areas, which was driven by increased magnitude in the higher, 85-130-Hz band (p = 0.02) and not the 65-85-Hz band.The THC-induced shift to faster gamma oscillations may represent an over-activation of the cortex, possibly related to saliency misattribution in the delusional state.},

  abstract    = {Pyramidal cells, expressing at least 14 subunits of the heteropentameric GABA(A) receptor, receive GABAergic input on their soma and proximal dendrites from basket cells, activating GABA(A) receptors and containing either parvalbumin or cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The properties of GABA(A) receptors are determined by the subunit composition, and synaptic receptor content governs the effect of the presynaptic neuron. Using a quantitative electron microscopic immunogold technique, we tested whether the synapses formed by the two types of basket cell show a difference in the subunit composition of GABA(A) receptors. Terminals of one of the basket cells were identified by antibodies to parvalbumin. Synapses made by parvalbumin-negative terminals showed five times more immunoreactivity for the alpha(2) subunit than synapses made by parvalbumin-positive basket cells, whose synapses were frequently immunonegative. This difference is likely to be due to specific GABA(A) receptor alpha subunit composition, because neither synaptic size nor immunoreactivity for the beta(2/3) subunits, indicating total receptor content, was different in these two synapse populations. Synapses established by axo-axonic cells on axon initial segments showed an intermediate number of immunoparticles for the alpha(2) subunit compared to those made by basket cells but, due to their smaller size, the density of the alpha(2) subunit immunoreactivity was higher in synapses on the axon. Because the two basket cell types innervate the same domain of the pyramidal cell, the results indicate that pyramidal cells have mechanisms to target GABA(A) receptors, under presynaptic influence, preferentially to distinct synapses. The two basket cell types act via partially distinct GABA(A) receptor populations.},

  abstract    = {Septohippocampal cholinergic neurons play key roles in learning and memory processes, and in the generation of hippocampal theta rhythm. The range of receptors for endogenous modulators expressed on these neurons is unclear. Here we describe GABA(B) 1a/b receptor (GABA(B)R) and type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB(1)R) expression in rat septal cholinergic [i.e. choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive] cells. Using double immunofluorescent staining, we found that almost two-thirds of the cholinergic cells in the rat medial septum were GABA(B)R positive, and that these cells had significantly larger somata than did GABA(B)R-negative cholinergic neurons. We detected CB(1)R labelling in somata after axonal protein transport was blocked by colchicine. In these animals about one-third of the cholinergic cells were CB(1)R positive. These cells again had larger somata than CB(1)R-negative cholinergic neurons. The analyses confirmed that the size of GABA(B)R-positive and CB(1)R-positive cholinergic cells were alike, and all CB(1)R-positive cholinergic cells were GABA(B)R positive as well. CB(1)R-positive cells were invariably ChAT positive. All retrogradely labelled septohippocampal cholinergic cells were positive for GABA(B)R and at least half of them also for CB(1)R. These data shed light on the existence of at least two cholinergic cell types in the medial septum: one expresses GABA(B)R and CB(1)R, has large somata and projects to the hippocampus, whereas the other is negative for GABA(B)R and CB(1)R and has smaller somata. The results also suggest that cholinergic transmission in the hippocampus is fine-tuned by endocannabinoid signalling.},

  abstract    = {Despite substantial effort and immense need, the treatment options for major neuropsychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia are limited and largely ineffective at improving the most debilitating cognitive symptoms that are central to mental illness. These symptoms include cognitive control deficits, the inability to selectively use information that is currently relevant and ignore what is currently irrelevant. Contemporary attempts to accelerate progress are in part founded on an effort to reconceptualize neuropsychiatric illness as a disorder of neural development. This neuro-developmental framework emphasizes abnormal neural circuits on the one hand, and on the other, it suggests there are therapeutic opportunities to exploit the developmental processes of excitatory neuron pruning, inhibitory neuron proliferation, elaboration of myelination, and other circuit refinements that extend through adolescence and into early adulthood. We have crafted a preclinical research program aimed at cognition failures that may be relevant to mental illness. By working with a variety of neurodevelopmental rodent models, we strive to identify a common pathophysiology that underlies cognitive control failure as well as a common strategy for improving cognition in the face of neural circuit abnormalities. Here we review our work to characterize cognitive control deficits in rats with a neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion and rats that were exposed to Methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) in utero. We review our findings as they pertain to early developmental processes, including neurogenesis, as well as the power of cognitive experience to refine neural circuit function within the mature and maturing brain's cognitive circuitry.},

  abstract    = {The prefrontal cortex has long been thought to subserve both working memory (the holding of information online for processing) and executive functions (deciding how to manipulate working memory and perform processing). Although many computational models of working memory have been developed, the mechanistic basis of executive function remains elusive, often amounting to a homunculus. This article presents an attempt to deconstruct this homunculus through powerful learning mechanisms that allow a computational model of the prefrontal cortex to control both itself and other brain areas in a strategic, task-appropriate manner. These learning mechanisms are based on subcortical structures in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and amygdala, which together form an actor-critic architecture. The critic system learns which prefrontal representations are task relevant and trains the actor, which in turn provides a dynamic gating mechanism for controlling working memory updating. Computationally, the learning mechanism is designed to simultaneously solve the temporal and structural credit assignment problems. The model's performance compares favorably with standard backpropagation-based temporal learning mechanisms on the challenging 1-2-AX working memory task and other benchmark working memory tasks.},

Following injections of Fast blue into monkey prefrontal cortex, retrogradely labeled, CCK-positive neurons were observed predominantly in rostromedial portions of the ventral mesencephalon; these CCK-containing projection neurons were not immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase. Furthermore, dual-labeling studies in the prefrontal cortex revealed that CCK and tyrosine hydroxylase were present in separate populations of axons. These results demonstrate that the CCK innervation of monkey prefrontal cortex arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources; in contrast to the rat, the extrinsic CCK innervation of monkey prefrontal cortex is distinct from the dopaminergic mesocortical projection.},

Although glutamate mediates synaptically confined point-to-point transmission, it has been suggested that under certain conditions glutamate may escape from the synaptic cleft (glutamate spillover), accumulate in the extrasynaptic space, and mediate volume transmission to regulate important brain functions. However, the inability to directly measure glutamate dynamics around active synapses has limited our understanding of glutamatergic volume transmission. The recent development of a family of fluorescent glutamate indicators has enabled the visualization of extrasynaptic glutamate dynamics in brain tissues. In this topical review, we examine glutamate as a volume transmitter based on novel results of glutamate imaging in the brain.},

  abstract    = {Systemic administration of NMDA receptor antagonists, used to model schizophrenia, increase the power of high-frequency oscillations (130-180Hz, HFO) in a variety of neuroanatomical and functionally distinct brain regions. However, it is unclear whether HFO are independently and locally generated or instead spread from a distant source. To address this issue, we used local infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to distinct brain areas to determine how accurately HFO recorded after injection of NMDAR antagonists reflect the activity actually generated at the electrode tip. Changes in power were evaluated in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex and caudate and in electrocorticograms (ECoGs) from visual and frontal areas. HFO recorded in frontal and visual cortices (ECoGs) or in the prefrontal cortex, caudate (LFPs) co-varied in power and frequency with observed changes in the NAc. TTX infusion to the NAc immediately and profoundly reduced the power of accumbal HFO which correlated with changes in HFO recorded in distant cortical sites. In contrast, TTX infusion to the prefrontal cortex did not change HFO power recorded locally, although gamma power was reduced. A very similar result was found after TTX infusion to the caudate. These findings raise the possibility that the NAc is an important neural generator. Our data also support existing studies challenging the idea that high frequencies recorded in LFPs are necessarily generated at the recording site.},

  abstract    = {Although dopamine (DA) effects in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been studied extensively, the function of steady-state ambient levels of DA in the regulation of afferent excitatory transmission in PFC pyramidal neurons remains relatively unexplored. Using intracellular sharp-electrode and whole-cell recordings combined with intracellular labeling in brain slices, we found that D1/D5 receptor blockade did not alter synaptic responses in the PFC, but D1/D5 receptor activation consistently enhanced recurrent synaptic excitation in the majority of pyramidal neurons tested. In contrast, D4 receptor blockade resulted in an evoked complex multiple spike discharge pattern that contained both early and late (presumably multisynaptic) components of the evoked response that is contingent upon the preservation of axon collaterals of the neuron under study. Moreover, GABAergic interneurons were found to play a role in both responses; blockade of GABA(a)-mediated inhibition caused bath application of DA to convert monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to complex spike bursts riding on the late component of the EPSP. On the other hand, during the blockade of GABA(a)-mediated conductances, administration of a D4 receptor antagonist failed to facilitate evoked multiple spike discharge. Morphological analysis of axon collaterals of labeled neurons revealed that neurons in which the D4 receptor blockade induced the putative polysynaptic response had axon collaterals that were largely preserved. These data suggest that DA exerts a bidirectional modulation of PFC pyramidal neurons in brain slices provided that local network connections with interneurons are preserved, with D4 receptors under tonic stimulation by ambient low levels of DA, whereas D1/D5 receptors activated upon phasic DA input.},

  abstract    = {The prefrontal cortex of the primate brain has a modular architecture based on the aggregation of neurons in minicolumnar arrangements having afferent and efferent connections distributed across many brain regions to represent, select and/or maintain behavioural goals and executive commands. Prefrontal cortical microcircuits are assumed to play a key role in the perception to action cycle that integrates relevant information about environment, and then selects and enacts behavioural responses. Thus, neurons within the interlaminar microcircuits participate in various functional states requiring the integration of signals across cortical layers and the selection of executive variables. Recent research suggests that executive abilities emerge from cortico-cortical interactions between interlaminar prefrontal cortical microcircuits, whereas their disruption is involved in a broad spectrum of neurologic and psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and drug addiction. The focus of this review is on the structural, functional and pathological approaches involving cortical minicolumns. Based on recent technological progress it has been demonstrated that microstimulation of infragranular cortical layers with patterns of microcurrents derived from supragranular layers led to an increase in cognitive performance. This suggests that interlaminar prefrontal cortical microcircuits are playing a causal role in improving cognitive performance. An important reason for the new interest in cortical modularity comes from both the impressive progress in understanding anatomical, physiological and pathological facets of cortical microcircuits and the promise of neural prosthetics for patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract    = {A common denominator for many cognitive disorders of human brain is the disruption of neural activity within pFC, whose structural basis is primarily interlaminar (columnar) microcircuits or "minicolumns." The importance of this brain region for executive decision-making has been well documented; however, because of technological constraints, the minicolumnar basis is not well understood. Here, via implementation of a unique conformal multielectrode recording array, the role of interlaminar pFC minicolumns in the executive control of task-related target selection is demonstrated in nonhuman primates performing a visuomotor DMS task. The results reveal target-specific, interlaminar correlated firing during the decision phase of the trial between multielectrode recording array-isolated minicolumnar pairs of neurons located in parallel in layers 2/3 and layer 5 of pFC. The functional significance of individual pFC minicolumns (separated by 40 μm) was shown by reduced correlated firing between cell pairs within single minicolumns on error trials with inappropriate target selection. To further demonstrate dependence on performance, a task-disrupting drug (cocaine) was administered in the middle of the session, which also reduced interlaminar firing in minicolumns that fired appropriately in the early (nondrug) portion of the session. The results provide a direct demonstration of task-specific, real-time columnar processing in pFC indicating the role of this type of microcircuit in executive control of decision-making in primate brain.},

Because antipsychotics reduce symptoms in schizophrenia, they may also reduce the effects of NMDA antagonists.In our study, a group of 18 healthy male volunteers was tested in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and P50 evoked potential paradigms during placebo-placebo, placebo-ketamine (.3 mg/kg; intravenous), and 2-mg haloperidol/.3 mg/kg intravenous ketamine conditions.Suppression of PPI and P50 in the ketamine condition did not differ from either the placebo-placebo or the haloperidol-ketamine condition; however, a significant reduction in percentage PPI to the lowest prepulse intensity and a reduction of P50 suppression were found in the haloperidol-ketamine condition.The combination of haloperidol and ketamine was found to disrupt P50 suppression and PPI in healthy male volunteers, whereas ketamine alone did not affect either measure. This may imply that the disrupted P50 suppression and PPI found in schizophrenia is related to reduced dopaminergic activity, most likely in the prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract    = {A growing number of studies demonstrate that antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors can induce a broad range of psychophysiological anomalies in healthy subjects similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In this study, the effect of a sub-anaesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, on human selective attention was explored. It was hypothesized that ketamine would induce in healthy subjects psychophysiological anomalies that are commonly observed in schizophrenic patients, such as reduced P300 amplitude and a reduction of both mismatch negativity (MMN) and processing negativity (PN). In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design, healthy male volunteers (n = 18) were challenged with a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) after which they were tested in a selective attention task. In this task, two types of stimuli were evenly presented to the left or right ear: standard tones (80\%) and deviant tones (20\%) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz. The duration of a stimulus (95 dB) was 50 ms, the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms. The volunteer was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear. Ketamine did not alter performance of the subjects: in both the placebo and drug condition their reaction times for and percentages of hits and false alarms did not differ. Ketamine did, however, reduce PN and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular). However, no drug effect on MMN was found. In addition, ketamine enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli. In conclusion, ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy controls that are observed in schizophrenic patients. Consequently, reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediated by spontaneous activation of GABAA receptors were studied using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in granule cells of the adult rat (postnatal day 60+) dentate gyrus in 400-microns-thick coronal half-brain slices maintained at 34-35 degrees C. The average amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents remained constant during a given recording period (i.e. no rundown was noted). The spontaneous currents had an average conductance between 200-400 pS, were mediated by Cl- flux through GABAA receptor/channels since they reversed at the Cl- equilibrium potential and were blocked by bicuculline or picrotoxin. Their mono-exponential decay time-constants (range: 4.2-7.2 ms) were prolonged by midazolam and pentobarbital in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of midazolam was reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (RO 15-1788) which, by itself, had no effect on the decay time-constant. The decay time-constant was also dependent on membrane voltage and on temperature. A 132-mV change in membrane potential produced an e-fold prolongation of the decay while the Q10 (between 22-37 degrees C) of the decay rate was 2.1. Within a given neuron, the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic events was remarkably constant over long time-periods, though the mean frequency among different cells showed large variability. Spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents also persisted under experimental conditions such as the presence of extracellular tetrodotoxin (1 microM), Cd2+ (200 microM) or lowered extracellular Ca2+/elevated Mg2+, which effectively abolished all stimulus-evoked GABAergic neurotransmission. The frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant miniature events was increased by elevating extracellular K+ concentration and was diminished by the GABAB receptor agonist (-)baclofen only at a dose (50 microM) which was an order of magnitude larger than that required to depress stimulus-evoked responses. These findings are consistent with different mechanisms being responsible for the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked release of GABA from interneuron terminals and also identify pre- and postsynaptic modulatory factors of the endogenous, action-potential-independent, GABAergic neurotransmission as being important determinants of the excitability level of mammalian CNS neurons.},

  abstract    = {Although endocannabinoids have emerged as essential retrograde messengers in several forms of synaptic plasticity, it remains controversial whether they mediate long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic synapses onto excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus. Here, we show that parvalbumin- and somatostatin/metabotropic glutamate receptor 1(a) (mGlu(1a))-positive GABAergic interneurons express diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGL-α), a synthesizing enzyme of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), albeit at lower levels than principal cells. Moreover, this lipase accumulates postsynaptically around afferent excitatory synapses in all three cell types. To address the role of retrograde 2-AG signaling in LTD, we investigated two forms: (1) produced by postsynaptic spiking paired with subsequent presynaptic stimulation or (2) induced by group I mGlu activation by (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). Neither form of LTD was evoked in the presence of the mGlu(5) antagonist MPEP [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine], the DGL inhibitor THL [N-formyl-l-leucine (1S)-1-[[(2S,3S)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]dodecyl ester], or the intracellularly applied Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA in CA1 pyramidal cells, fast-spiking interneurons (representing parvalbumin-containing cells) and interneurons projecting to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (representing somatostatin/mGlu(1a)-expressing interneurons). Both forms of LTD were completely absent in CB(1) cannabinoid receptor knock-out mice, whereas pharmacological blockade of CB(1) led to inconsistent results. Notably, in accordance with their lower DGL-α level, a higher stimulation frequency or higher DHPG concentration was required for LTD induction in interneurons compared with pyramidal cells. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal principal cells and interneurons produce endocannabinoids to mediate LTD in a qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different manner. The shifted induction threshold implies that endocannabinoid-LTD contributes to cortical information processing during distinct network activity patterns in a cell type-specific manner.},

  abstract  = {The spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a synaptic learning rule for encoding learning and memory, relies on relative timing of neuronal activity on either side of the synapse. GABAergic signaling has been shown to control neuronal excitability and consequently the spike timing, but whether GABAergic circuits rule the STDP remained unknown. Here we show that GABAergic signaling governs the polarity of STDP, because blockade of GABAA receptors was able to completely reverse the temporal order of plasticity at corticostriatal synapses in rats and mice. GABA controls the polarity of STDP in both striatopallidal and striatonigral output neurons. Biophysical simulations and experimental investigations suggest that GABA controls STDP polarity through depolarizing effects at distal dendrites of striatal output neurons by modifying the balance of two calcium sources, NMDARs and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. These findings establish a central role for GABAergic circuits in shaping STDP and suggest that GABA could operate as a Hebbian/anti-Hebbian switch.},

  abstract    = {The Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme is a membrane-bound serine hydrolase responsible for the deactivating hydrolysis of a family of naturally occurring fatty acid amides. FAAH is a critical enzyme of the endocannabinoid system, being mainly responsible for regulating the level of its main cannabinoid substrate anandamide. For this reason, pharmacological inhibition of FAAH, which increases the level of endogenous anandamide, is a promising strategy to cure a variety of diseases including pain, inflammation, and cancer. Much structural, mutagenesis, and kinetic data on FAAH has been generated over the last couple of decades. This has prompted several informative computational investigations to elucidate, at the atomic-level, mechanistic details on catalysis and inhibition of this pharmaceutically relevant enzyme. Here, we review how these computational studies - based on classical molecular dynamics, full quantum mechanics, and hybrid QM/MM methods - have clarified the binding and reactivity of some relevant substrates and inhibitors of FAAH. We also discuss the experimental implications of these computational insights, which have provided a thoughtful elucidation of the complex physical and chemical steps of the enzymatic mechanism of FAAH. Finally, we discuss how computations have been helpful for building structure-activity relationships of potent FAAH inhibitors.},

Components mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid {(AMPA)} and by {N-methyl-D-aspartate} {(NMDA)} receptors were separated pharmacologically. Quantal parameters of {AMPA} and {NMDA} receptor-mediated {EPSCs} were obtained using both maximal likelihood and autocorrelation techniques. Enhancement of transmitter release with 4-aminopyridine caused a significant increase in quantal size of {NMDA} {EPSC.} This was accompanied by a slowing of the {EPSC} decay. The maximal number of quanta in the {NMDA} current was unchanged, while the probability of quantal event dramatically enhanced. In contrast, neither the quantal size nor the kinetics of {AMPA} {EPSC} was altered by 4-aminopyridine, while the maximal number of quanta increased. These changes in the quantal parameters are consistent with a transition to multivesicular release of the neurotransmitter. Spillover of excessive glutamate on the nonsynaptic areas of dendritic spines causes an increase in the quantal size of {NMDA} synaptic current. The difference in quantal behavior of {AMPA} and {NMDA} {EPSCs} implies that different mechanisms underlie their quantization: the additive response of nonsaturated {AMPA} receptors contrasts with the variable involvement of saturated intrasynaptic and nonsaturated extrasynaptic {NMDA} receptors.},

Because of their involvement in numerous neurological disorders, {NMDARs} are also targets of therapeutic interest. {NMDARs} occur as multiple subtypes which differ in their subunit composition and in their biophysical and pharmacological properties. In particular, {NMDARs} contain a diversity of sites at which endogenous ligands or pharmacological agents can act to modulate receptor activity in a subunit-selective manner, and recent structural and functional data have started to reveal the molecular determinants for this subunit selectivity. These include the binding sites for glutamate, the ion-channel pore and the recently identified allosteric sites on the N-terminal domain. Other potential sites yet unexplored by medicinal chemistry programs are also considered, in particular at the interface between subunits. Given the growing body of evidence that diverse brain disorders implicate different {NMDAR} subtypes, such as {NR2B} in pain or {NR3A} in white matter injury, there is a growing interest in exploiting the pharmacological heterogeneity of {NMDARs} for the development of novel {NMDAR} subtype-selective compounds.},

  abstract    = {Working memory refers to the temporary storage of information and is strongly associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Persistent activity of cortical neurons, namely the activity that persists beyond the stimulus presentation, is considered the cellular correlate of working memory. Although past studies suggested that this type of activity is characteristic of large scale networks, recent experimental evidence imply that small, tightly interconnected clusters of neurons in the cortex may support similar functionalities. However, very little is known about the biophysical mechanisms giving rise to persistent activity in small-sized microcircuits in the PFC. Here, we present a detailed biophysically-yet morphologically simplified-microcircuit model of layer V PFC neurons that incorporates connectivity constraints and is validated against a multitude of experimental data. We show that (a) a small-sized network can exhibit persistent activity under realistic stimulus conditions. (b) Its emergence depends strongly on the interplay of dADP, NMDA, and GABAB currents. (c) Although increases in stimulus duration increase the probability of persistent activity induction, variability in the stimulus firing frequency does not consistently influence it. (d) Modulation of ionic conductances (I h , I D , I sAHP, I caL, I caN, I caR) differentially controls persistent activity properties in a location dependent manner. These findings suggest that modulation of the microcircuit's firing characteristics is achieved primarily through changes in its intrinsic mechanism makeup, supporting the hypothesis of multiple bi-stable units in the PFC. Overall, the model generates a number of experimentally testable predictions that may lead to a better understanding of the biophysical mechanisms of persistent activity induction and modulation in the PFC.},

  abstract    = {In the hippocampus, parvalbumin-expressing basket (BC) and axo-axonic cells (AAC) show different discharge patterns during distinct network states, but the cellular mechanisms underlying these differences are not well understood. Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, we investigated the single-cell properties and excitatory synaptic features of anatomically identified BCs and AACs in the CA3 region of mouse hippocampal slices. The results showed that BCs had lower threshold for action potential (AP) generation and lower input resistance, narrower AP and afterhyperpolarization than AACs. In addition, BCs fired with higher frequencies and with more modest accommodation compared with AACs. The kinetic properties of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC), the rectification of AMPA receptor-mediated currents, the fraction of the NMDA receptor-mediated component in EPSCs, and the EPSC magnitude necessary to evoke an AP were similar in both cell types. However, smaller excitatory postsynaptic potential and lower intensity fiber stimulation in stratum oriens was necessary to drive firing in BCs. Moreover, the rate of spontaneous EPSCs in BCs was higher than in AACs. Neurolucida analysis revealed that the dendrites of BCs in strata radiatum and oriens were longer and more extensively ramified. Since the density of the excitatory synapses was estimated to be comparable in both cell types, we conclude that the more elaborated dendritic arbor of BCs ensures that they receive a larger number of proximal excitatory inputs. Thus, CA3 pyramidal cells more profoundly innervate BCs than AACs, which could explain, at least in part, their distinct spiking behavior under different hippocampal network activities.},

Unfortunately, many controversies exist, not least the seemingly simple issue concerning the locus of expression of LTP. Here, we review our recent work and some of the extensive literature on this topic and present new data that collectively suggest that LTP can be explained, during its first few hours, by the coexistence of at least three mechanistically distinct processes that are all triggered by the synaptic activation of NMDARs.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia associates with impaired prefrontal cortical (PFC) function and alterations in cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathways. These include genetic insults to disrupted-in-schizophrenia (DISC1) and phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) regulating cAMP hydrolysis, and increased dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) expression that elevates cAMP. We used immunoelectron microscopy to localize DISC1, PDE4A, PDE4B, and D1R in monkey PFC and to view spatial interactions with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that gate network inputs when opened by cAMP. Physiological interactions between PDE4s and HCN channels were tested in recordings of PFC neurons in monkeys performing a spatial working memory task. The study reveals a constellation of cAMP-related proteins (DISC1, PDE4A, and D1R) and HCN channels next to excitatory synapses and the spine neck in thin spines of superficial PFC, where working memory microcircuits interconnect and spine loss is most evident in schizophrenia. In contrast, channels in dendrites were distant from synapses and cAMP-related proteins, and were associated with endosomal trafficking. The data suggest that a cAMP signalplex is selectively positioned in the spines to gate PFC pyramidal cell microcircuits. Single-unit recordings confirmed physiological interactions between cAMP and HCN channels, consistent with gating actions. These data may explain why PFC networks are especially vulnerable to genetic insults that dysregulate cAMP signaling.},

However, a wide range of gating ratios has been reported in the literature for both groups. The purpose of this study was to compile these findings and to compare reported P50 gating ratios in controls and patients with schizophrenia. Current data collected from individual controls in eight studies from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Indiana University (IU), and Yale University also are reported. The IU, UCI, and Yale data showed that approximately 40\% of controls had P50 ratios within 1 S.D. below the mean of means for patients with schizophrenia. The meta-analysis rejected the null hypothesis that all studies showed no effect. The meta-analysis also showed that the differences were not the same across all studies. The mean ratios in 45 of the 46 group comparisons were smaller for controls than for patients, and the observed difference in means was significant for 35 of those studies. Reported gating ratios for controls from two laboratories whose findings were reported in the literature differed from all the other control groups. Variables affecting the gating ratio included band pass filter setting, rules regarding the inclusion of P30, sex, and age. Standards of P50 collection and measurement would help determine whether the gating ratio can be sufficiently reliable to be labeled an endophenotype, and suggestions are made toward this goal.},

Of 36 PV-IR cells, 29 were basket cells, with most of their axonal arbours in the stratum pyramidale (SP). Six were bistratified cells with axons ramifying throughout stratum oriens (SO) and stratum radiatum (SR). One was a putative axo-axonic cell with an axonal arbour confined to half of the SP and a narrow adjacent region of the SO. Of 27 CCK-IR neurones, 13 were basket cells, with most of their axonal arbours in the SP, and included basket cells with somata in the SP (6), SO (3), and SR (2) and at the border between the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) and the SR (2). In addition, several dendrite-targeting cell classes expressed CCK-IR: 4 of 9 bistratified cells with axons ramifying in the SO and SR; all five Schaffer-associated cells whose axons ramified extensively in the SR; both cells classified as quadrilaminar because their axons ramified in the SO, SP, SR, and SLM; one SO-SO cell whose dendritic and axonal arbours were contained within the SO; and one perforant path-associated cell with axonal and dendritic arbours within the distal SR and SLM. The majority (31 of 36) of PV-IR neurones recorded were fast-spiking, and most fast-spiking cells tested (25 of 29 basket, 1 axo-axonic, and 5 of 6 bistratified cells) were PV-IR. However, 1 of 6 regular-spiking basket, 1 of 4 regular-spiking bistratified, and 3 of 5 burst-firing basket cells were also PV-IR. In contrast, the majority (17 of 27) of the CCK-IR neurones recorded were regular-spiking, 3 were burst-firing, and 7 were fast-spiking. These data confirm that the majority of PV-IR and CCK-IR axon terminals innervate proximal portions of CA1 pyramidal cells. Most PV-IR cells are fast-spiking, whereas most CCK-IR cells are regular-spiking. In both neurochemical classes basket cells predominate, but both groups included subpopulations of dendrite-targeting cells. Despite these similarities, the two populations exhibited very different somatic distributions, and each contained cellular morphologies not represented in the other.},

  abstract    = {Memory formation requires the placement of experienced events in the same order in which they appeared. A large body of evidence from human studies indicates that structures in the medial temporal lobe are critically involved in forming and maintaining such memories, and complementing evidence from lesion and electrophysiological work in animals support these findings. However, it remains unclear how single cells and networks of cells can signal this temporal relationship between events. Here we used recordings from single cells in the human brain obtained while subjects viewed repeated presentations of cinematic episodes. We found that neuronal activity in successive time segments became gradually correlated, and, as a result, activity in a given time window became a faithful predictor of the activity to follow. This correlation emerged rapidly, within two to three presentations of an episode and exceeded both context-independent and pure stimulus-driven correlations. The correlation was specific for hippocampal neurons, did not occur in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, and was found for single cells, cell pairs, and triplets of cells, supporting the notion that cell assemblies code for the temporal relationships between sensory events. Importantly, this neuronal measure of temporal binding successfully predicted subjects' ability to recall and verbally report the viewed episodes later. Our findings suggest a neuronal substrate for the formation of memory of the temporal order of events.},

  abstract    = {Endogenous opioid and non-opioid mechanisms (for example, dopamine (DA), endocannabinoids (eCB)) have been implicated in the formation of placebo analgesic effects, with initial reports dating back three decades. Besides the perspective that placebo effects confound randomized clinical trials, the information so far acquired points to neurobiological systems that when activated by positive expectations and maintained through conditioning and reward learning are capable of inducing physiological changes that lead to the experience of analgesia and improvements in emotional state. Molecular neuroimaging techniques with positron emission tomography and the selective μ-opioid and D2/3 radiotracers [(11)C]carfentanil and [(11)C]raclopride have significantly contributed to our understanding of the neurobiological systems involved in the formation of placebo effects. This line of research has described neural and neurotransmitter networks implicated in placebo responses and provided the technical tools to examine inter-individual differences in the function of placebo-responsive mechanisms, and potential surrogates (biomarkers). As a consequence, the formation of biological placebo effects is now being linked to the concept of resiliency mechanisms, partially determined by genetic factors, and uncovered by the cognitive emotional integration of the expectations created by the therapeutic environment and its maintenance through learning mechanisms. Further work needs to extend this research into clinical conditions where the rates of placebo responses are high and its neurobiological mechanisms have been largely unexplored (for example, mood and anxiety disorders, persistent pain syndromes or even Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis). The delineation of these processes within and across diseases would point to biological targets that have not been contemplated in traditional drug development.},

Most previous studies on schizophrenia have considered high-band connectivity in preference to the Alpha band, as there has been some uncertainty correlating the latter to the condition. In this paper we attempt to clarify this correlation using an Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis of the Alpha band from schizophrenic patients. Global, regional Omega and dimensional complexity and local Omega complexity differentials (LCD) of single channel are calculated using 16 channels of resting EEG data from 31 adult patients with schizophrenia and 31 age/sex matched control subjects. It was found that, compared to the controls, anterior alpha Omega and dimensional complexity are higher in schizophrenia patients (p<0.05) with the single channel LCD also increasing at FP1, FP2, F7 and F8 electrodes. Furthermore, higher left hemisphere dimensional complexity and LCD at T3 point was also found. The results suggest there is lower connectivity in the pre-frontal and left temporal regions with respect to the alpha band in schizophrenia patients.},

  abstract    = {Recent studies have shown that reverberation underlying mnemonic persistent activity must be slow, to ensure the stability of a working memory system and to give rise to long neural transients capable of accumulation of information over time. Is the slower the underlying process, the better? To address this question, we investigated 3 slow biophysical mechanisms that are activity-dependent and prominently present in the prefrontal cortex: Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), calcium-dependent nonspecific cationic current (ICAN), and short-term facilitation. Using a spiking network model for spatial working memory, we found that these processes enhance the memory accuracy by counteracting noise-induced drifts, heterogeneity-induced biases, and distractors. Furthermore, the incorporation of DSI and ICAN enlarges the range of network's parameter values required for working memory function. However, when a progressively slower process dominates the network, it becomes increasingly more difficult to erase a memory trace. We demonstrate this accuracy-flexibility tradeoff quantitatively and interpret it using a state-space analysis. Our results supports the scenario where N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent recurrent excitation is the workhorse for the maintenance of persistent activity, whereas slow synaptic or cellular processes contribute to the robustness of mnemonic function in a tradeoff that potentially can be adjusted according to behavioral demands.},

Here we find no differences in somatic amplitude between A/C and PP for either AMPA or NMDA uEPSPs. However, larger AMPA uEPSCs were evoked from proximal than from distal A/C or PP. Given the space-clamp constraints in CA3 pyramidal cells, these voltage clamp data suggest that the location-independence of A/C and PP AMPA uEPSP amplitudes is achieved in part through the activation of voltage dependent conductances at or near the soma. Moreover, similarity in uEPSC amplitudes for distal A/C and PP points to the additional participation of unclamped active conductances. Indeed, the pharmacological blockade of voltage-dependent conductances eliminates the location-independence of these inputs. In contrast, the location-independence of A/C and PP NMDA uEPSP/uEPSC amplitudes is maintained across all conditions indicating that propagation is not affected by active membrane processes. The location-independence for A/C uEPSP amplitudes may be relevant in the recruitment of CA3 pyramidal cells by other CA3 pyramidal cells. These data also suggest that PP excitation represents a significant input to CA3 pyramidal cells. Implication of the passive data on local synaptic properties is further investigated in the companion paper with a detailed computational model.},

  abstract    = {The cannabinoid (CB) system is a key neurochemical mediator of anxiety and fear learning in both animals and humans. The anxiolytic effects of delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, are believed to be mediated through direct and selective agonism of CB(1) receptors localized within the basolateral amygdala, a critical brain region for threat perception. However, little is known about the effects of THC on amygdala reactivity in humans. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well validated task to probe amygdala responses to threat signals in 16 healthy, recreational cannabis users after a double-blind crossover administration of THC or placebo. We found that THC significantly reduced amygdala reactivity to social signals of threat but did not affect activity in primary visual and motor cortex. The current findings fit well with the notion that THC and other cannabinoids may have an anxiolytic role in central mechanisms of fear behaviors and provide a rationale for exploring novel therapeutic strategies that target the cannabinoid system for disorders of anxiety and social fear.},

  abstract    = {Neuronal synchronization at gamma frequency, implicated in cognition, can be evoked in hippocampal slices by pharmacological activation. We characterized spontaneous small-amplitude gamma oscillations (SgammaO) recorded in area CA3 of mouse hippocampal slices and compared it with kainate-induced gamma oscillations (KgammaO). SgammaO had a lower peak frequency, a more sinusoidal waveform and was spatially less coherent than KgammaO, irrespective of oscillation amplitude. CA3a had the smallest oscillation power, phase-led CA3c by approximately 4 ms and had the highest SgammaO frequency in isolated subslices. During SgammaO CA3c neurons fired at the rebound of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that were associated with a current source in stratum lucidum, whereas CA3a neurons often fired from spikelets, 3-4 ms earlier in the cycle, and had smaller IPSPs. Kainate induced faster/larger IPSPs that were associated with an earlier current source in stratum pyramidale. SgammaO and KgammaO power were dependent on alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, gap junctions and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors. SgammaO was suppressed by elevating extracellular KCl, blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors or muscarinic receptors, or activating GluR5-containing kainate receptors. SgammaO was not affected by blocking metabotropic glutamate receptors or hyperpolarization-activated currents. The adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethoxyxanthine (8-CPT) and the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251) increased SgammaO power, indicating that endogenous adenosine and/or endocannabinoids suppress or prevent SgammaO in vitro. SgammaO emerges from a similar basic network as KgammaO, but differs in involvement of somatically projecting interneurons and pharmacological modulation profile. These observations advocate the use of SgammaO as a natural model for hippocampal gamma oscillations, particularly during less activated behavioural states.},

This occurred alongside NMDA up-regulation in prefrontal cortex and CA1-3, but not in striatum and DG. PCP with Brahmi showed a significant increase in DR score compared with PCP alone. This occurred alongside significant decrease in NMDA immunodensity in prefrontal cortex and CA1-3. No significant difference in cerebral NMDA immunodensity was observed between PCP with Brahmi and control.Cognitive deficit observed in PCP-administered rats was mediated by NMDA up-regulation in prefrontal cortex and CA1-3.

Detailed surface analyses of the hippocampus further localized these differences to an enlarged head of the hippocampus in the ADHD group. Although conventional measures did not detect significant differences in amygdalar volumes, surface analyses indicated the presence of reduced size bilaterally over the area of the basolateral complex. Correlations with prefrontal measures suggested abnormal connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in the ADHD group. Enlarged subregions of the hippocampus tended to accompany fewer symptoms.The enlarged hippocampus in children and adolescents with ADHD may represent a compensatory response to the presence of disturbances in the perception of time, temporal processing (eg, delay aversion), and stimulus seeking associated with ADHD. Disrupted connections between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex may contribute to behavioral disinhibition. Our findings suggest involvement of the limbic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD.},

  abstract    = {Working memory (WM) is the ability to transiently maintain and manipulate internal representations beyond its external availability to the senses. This process is thought to support high level cognitive abilities and been shown to be strongly predictive of individual intelligence and reasoning abilities. While early models of WM have relied on a modular perspective of brain functioning, more recent evidence suggests that cognitive functions emerge from the interactions of multiple brain regions to generate large-scale networks. Here we will review the current research on functional connectivity of WM processes to highlight the critical role played by neural interactions in healthy and pathological brain states. Recent findings demonstrate that WM abilities are not determined solely by local brain activity, but also rely on the functional coupling of neocortical-hippocampal regions to support WM processes. Although the hippocampus has long been held to be important for long-term declarative memory, recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus may also be necessary to coordinate disparate cortical regions supporting the periodic reactivation of internal representations in WM. Furthermore, recent brain imaging studies using connectivity measures, have shown that changes in cortico-limbic interactions can be useful to characterize WM impairments observed in different neuropathological conditions. Recent advances in electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques to model network activity has led to important insights into how neocortical and hippocampal regions support WM processes and how disruptions along this network can lead to the memory impairments commonly reported in many neuropathological populations.},

  abstract    = {Converging evidence from neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies indicates that heavy marijuana use is associated with cingulate dysfunction. However, there has been limited human data documenting in vivo biochemical brain changes after chronic marijuana exposure. Previous proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have demonstrated reduced basal ganglia glutamate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex N-acetyl aspartate levels in adult chronic marijuana users. Similar studies have not been reported in adolescent populations. The present study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine whether reductions in glutamate, N-acetyl aspartate and/or other proton metabolite concentrations would be found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of adolescent marijuana users compared with non-using controls. Adolescent marijuana users (N=17; average age 17.8 years) and similarly aged healthy control subjects (N=17; average age 16.2 years) were scanned using a Siemens 3T Trio MRI system. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were acquired from a 22.5 mL voxel positioned bilaterally within the ACC. Spectra were fitted using commercial software and all metabolite integrals were normalized to the scaled unsuppressed water integral. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were performed to compare between-group metabolite levels. The marijuana-using cohort showed statistically significant reductions in anterior cingulate glutamate (-15\%, p<0.01), N-acetyl aspartate (-13\%, p=0.02), total creatine (-10\%, p<0.01) and myo-inositol (-10\%, p=0.03). Within-voxel tissue-type segmentation did not reveal any significant differences in gray/white matter or cerebrospinal fluid content between the two groups. The reduced glutamate and N-acetyl aspartate levels in the adolescent marijuana-using cohort are consistent with precedent human (1)H MRS data, and likely reflect an alteration of anterior cingulate glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuronal integrity within these individuals. The reduced total creatine and myo-inositol levels observed in these subjects might infer altered ACC energetic status and glial metabolism, respectively. These results expand on previous functional MRI data reporting altered cingulate function in individuals with marijuana-abuse.},

GABA-modulating pharmacologic treatments that elevate brain GABA concentration recently have been shown to decrease withdrawal symptoms and improve executive functioning in marijuana-dependent adult subjects. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the lower ACC glutamate previously reported in adolescent chronic marijuana smokers is associated with lower ACC GABA levels.Standard and metabolite-edited proton MRS data were acquired from adolescent marijuana users (N=13) and similarly aged non-using controls (N=16) using a clinical 3T MRI system.The adolescent marijuana-using cohort showed significantly lower ACC GABA levels (-22\%, p=0.03), which paralleled significantly lower ACC glutamate levels (-14\%, p=0.01). Importantly, the lower ACC GABA and glutamate levels detected in the adolescent cohort remained significant after controlling for age and sex.The present spectroscopic findings support functional neuroimaging data documenting cingulate dysfunction in marijuana-dependent adolescents. Glutamatergic and GABAergic abnormalities potentially underlie cingulate dysfunction in adolescent chronic marijuana users, and the opportunity for testing suitable pharmacologic treatments with a non-invasive pharmacodynamic evaluation exists.},

  abstract    = {Scalp electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography studies have revealed a rapid evoked potential "adaptation" where one visual stimulus suppresses the event-related potential (ERP) of the second stimulus. Here, we investigated a similar effect revealed in subdural intracranial recordings in humans. Our results show that the suppression of the subdural ERP is not associated with a reduction in the gamma frequency power, considered to reflect the underlying neural activity. Furthermore, the evoked potential suppression (EPS) phenomenon was not reflected in recognition behavior of the patients. Rather, the EPS was tightly linked to the level of gamma activity preceding the event, and this effect was independent of the interstimulus time interval. Analyzing other frequency bands failed to reveal a similar link. Our results thus show a consistent antagonism between subdural ERP and gamma power although both are considered markers for neural activity. We hypothesize that the ERP suppression is due to a desynchronization of neuronal firing resulting from recurrent neural activity in the vicinity of the freshly stimulated neurons and not an attenuation of the overall neural activity.},

  abstract    = {Findings from family and twin studies suggest that genetic contributions to psychiatric disorders do not in all cases map to present diagnostic categories. We aimed to identify specific variants underlying genetic effects shared between the five disorders in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium: autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.We analysed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for the five disorders in 33,332 cases and 27,888 controls of European ancestory. To characterise allelic effects on each disorder, we applied a multinomial logistic regression procedure with model selection to identify the best-fitting model of relations between genotype and phenotype. We examined cross-disorder effects of genome-wide significant loci previously identified for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and used polygenic risk-score analysis to examine such effects from a broader set of common variants. We undertook pathway analyses to establish the biological associations underlying genetic overlap for the five disorders. We used enrichment analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to assess whether SNPs with cross-disorder association were enriched for regulatory SNPs in post-mortem brain-tissue samples.SNPs at four loci surpassed the cutoff for genome-wide significance (p<5×10(-8)) in the primary analysis: regions on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24, and SNPs within two L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, CACNA1C and CACNB2. Model selection analysis supported effects of these loci for several disorders. Loci previously associated with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia had variable diagnostic specificity. Polygenic risk scores showed cross-disorder associations, notably between adult-onset disorders. Pathway analysis supported a role for calcium channel signalling genes for all five disorders. Finally, SNPs with evidence of cross-disorder association were enriched for brain eQTL markers.Our findings show that specific SNPs are associated with a range of psychiatric disorders of childhood onset or adult onset. In particular, variation in calcium-channel activity genes seems to have pleiotropic effects on psychopathology. These results provide evidence relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry, and towards a nosology informed by disease cause.National Institute of Mental Health.},

Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.},

In addition, non-amnesic doses of either the mTOR blocker rapamycin or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin abrogated the amnesic-like effects of THC, pointing to a mechanism involving new protein synthesis. Moreover, using pharmacological and genetic tools, we found that THC long-term memory deficits were mediated by CB1Rs expressed on GABAergic interneurons through a glutamatergic mechanism, as both the amnesic-like effects and p70S6K phosphorylation were reduced in GABA-CB1R knockout mice and by NMDA blockade.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal abnormalities have been demonstrated in schizophrenia. It is unclear whether these abnormalities worsen with age, and whether they affect cognition and function.To determine whether hippocampal abnormalities in chronic schizophrenia are associated with age, cognition and socio-occupational function.Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging we scanned 100 persons aged 19-82 years: 51 were out-patients with stable schizophrenia at least 2 years after diagnosis and 49 were healthy volunteers matched for age and gender. Automated analysis was used to determine hippocampal volume and shape.There were differential effects of age in the schizophrenia and control samples on total hippocampal volume (group × age interaction: F(1,95) = 6.57, P = 0.012), with steeper age-related reduction in the schizophrenia group. Three-dimensional shape analysis located the age-related deformations predominantly in the mid-body of the hippocampus. In the schizophrenia group similar patterns of morphometric abnormalities were correlated with impaired cognition and poorer socio-occupational function.Hippocampal abnormalities are associated with age in people with chronic schizophrenia, with a steeper decline than in healthy individuals. These abnormalities are associated with cognitive and functional deficits, suggesting that hippocampal morphometry may be a biomarker for cognitive decline in older patients with schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide, with ~5 million daily users worldwide. Emerging evidence supports a number of associations between cannabis and psychosis/psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia. These associations-based on case-studies, surveys, epidemiological studies, and experimental studies indicate that cannabinoids can produce acute, transient effects; acute, persistent effects; and delayed, persistent effects that recapitulate the psychopathology and psychophysiology seen in schizophrenia. Acute exposure to both cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids (Spice/K2) can produce a full range of transient psychotomimetic symptoms, cognitive deficits, and psychophysiological abnormalities that bear a striking resemblance to symptoms of schizophrenia. In individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Several factors appear to moderate these associations, including family history, genetic factors, history of childhood abuse, and the age at onset of cannabis use. Exposure to cannabinoids in adolescence confers a higher risk for psychosis outcomes in later life and the risk is dose-related. Individuals with polymorphisms of COMT and AKT1 genes may be at increased risk for psychotic disorders in association with cannabinoids, as are individuals with a family history of psychotic disorders or a history of childhood trauma. The relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia fulfills many but not all of the standard criteria for causality, including temporality, biological gradient, biological plausibility, experimental evidence, consistency, and coherence. At the present time, the evidence indicates that cannabis may be a component cause in the emergence of psychosis, and this warrants serious consideration from the point of view of public health policy.},

Both short-term (3 weeks) and long-term (8 months) haloperidol administration increased the concentration of CCK in the substantia nigra. While short-term administration significantly increased the concentration of CCK in the ventral tegmental area and decreased the concentration of CCK in the cortex, including the medial prefrontal cortex, these effects were not observed following long-term drug administration. In contrast, long-term, but not short-term, haloperidol administration decreased the concentration of CCK in the olfactory tubercle. Withdrawal from long-term haloperidol did not alter CCK concentrations in any of the brain regions examined. Short-term haloperidol administration significantly increased the concentration of neurotensin in the caudate-putamen. Both short- and long-term administration increased the concentration of neurotensin in the nucleus accumbens, but only the increased following long-term administration reached statistical significance. Withdrawal from long-term haloperidol administration slightly decreased the concentrations of neurotensin in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that dopamine receptor blockade can affect both CCK- and neurotensin-containing neural systems. Furthermore, these two neuropeptides are affected differently depending upon the duration of haloperidol administration and withdrawal from this drug. The results raise the possibility that chronic administration of haloperidol may be toxic to some neurotensin-containing neurons in the basal ganglia.},

  abstract    = {Performance impairment during Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intoxication has been well described in occasional cannabis users. It is less clear whether tolerance develops to the impairing effects of THC in heavy users of cannabis. The aim of the present study was to assess neurocognitive performance during acute THC intoxication in occasional and heavy users. Twenty-four subjects (12 occasional cannabis users and 12 heavy cannabis users) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way mixed model design. Both groups received single doses of THC placebo and 500 microg/kg THC by smoking. Performance tests were conducted at regular intervals between 0 and 8 h after smoking, and included measures of perceptual motor control (critical tracking task), dual task processing (divided attention task), motor inhibition (stop signal task) and cognition (Tower of London). THC significantly impaired performance of occasional cannabis users on critical tracking, divided attention and the stop signal task. THC did not affect the performance of heavy cannabis users except in the stop signal task, i.e. stop reaction time increased, particularly at high THC concentrations. Group comparisons of overall performance in occasional and heavy users did not reveal any persistent performance differences due to residual THC in heavy users. These data indicate that cannabis use history strongly determines the behavioural response to single doses of THC.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of pretreatment with the MOR antagonist, naltrexone, on the subjective, behavioural and cognitive effects of the CB1R agonist, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), in healthy human subjects. Healthy human subjects, screened carefully for any medical or psychiatric illness, were administered either placebo or active naltrexone (25 mg) orally on each test day, followed 45 min later by placebo and 165 min later by active i.v. THC (0.025 mg/kg) in a randomized, fixed-order, double-blind manner. Subjective, behavioural and cognitive effects were assessed before and at several points after each drug administration. THC produced expected effects, including euphoria, anxiety, transient perceptual alterations, transient psychotomimetic effects and cognitive impairments. However, naltrexone did not produce any effects alone, nor did it attenuate any of THC's effects. Thus, in healthy human subjects who use cannabis intermittently, MOR antagonism does not modulate the common acute subjective, behavioural and cognitive effects of THC.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most robust effects on short-term episodic and working memory in humans. A large body of the work in this area occurred in the 1970s before the discovery of cannabinoid receptors. Recent advances in the knowledge of cannabinoid receptors' function have rekindled interest in examining effects of exogenous cannabinoids on memory and in understanding the mechanism of these effects.The literature about the acute effects of cannabinoids on memory tasks in humans is reviewed. The limitations of the human literature including issues of dose, route of administration, small sample sizes, sample selection, effects of other drug use, tolerance and dependence to cannabinoids, and the timing and sensitivity of psychological tests are discussed. Finally, the human literature is discussed against the backdrop of preclinical findings.Acute administration of Delta-9-THC transiently impairs immediate and delayed free recall of information presented after, but not before, drug administration in a dose- and delay-dependent manner. In particular, cannabinoids increase intrusion errors. These effects are more robust with the inhaled and intravenous route and correspond to peak drug levels.This profile of effects suggests that cannabinoids impair all stages of memory including encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Several mechanisms, including effects on long-term potentiation and long-term depression and the inhibition of neurotransmitter (GABA, glutamate, acetyl choline, dopamine) release, have been implicated in the amnestic effects of cannabinoids. Future research in humans is necessary to characterize the neuroanatomical and neurochemical basis of the memory impairing effects of cannabinoids, to dissect out their effects on the various stages of memory and to bridge the expanding gap between the humans and preclinical literature.},

  abstract    = {Salvia divinorum (Salvia) is an increasingly popular recreational drug amongst adolescents and young adults. Its primary active ingredient, Salvinorin A (SA)-a highly selective agonist at the κ opiate receptor-is believed to be one of the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogens. However, there is little experimental data on the effects of SA in humans.In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, psychophysiological, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg of inhaled SA were characterized in 10 healthy individuals who had previously used Salvia.SA produced psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations, including dissociative and somaesthetic effects, increased plasma cortisol and prolactin, and reduced resting electroencephalogram spectral power. The SA administration was associated with a rapid increase of its levels in the blood. SA did not produce euphoria, cognitive deficits, or changes in vital signs. The effects were transient and not dose-related. SA administration was very well-tolerated without acute or delayed adverse effects.SA produced a wide range of transient effects in healthy subjects. The perceptual altering effects and lack of euphoric effects would explain its intermittent use pattern. Such a profile would also suggest a low addictive potential similar to other hallucinogens and consistent with κ opiate receptor agonism. Further work is warranted to carefully characterize a full spectrum of its effects in humans, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved, and to explore the basis for individual variability in its effects.},

  abstract  = {Classical antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol produce akinesia and catalepsy, whereas clozapine and related atypical antipsychotics fail to elicit these behaviors even at relatively high doses. Despite these behavioral differences, a cataleptic dose of haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg) produces changes in neuronal activity in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens comparable to those produced by a non-cataleptic dose of clozapine (20.0 mg/kg). To further elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying the differential behavioral response to these drugs, an electrophysiological analysis was extended to neurons in the rat amygdaloid complex. Whereas an intraperitoneal injection of 2.0 mg/kg haloperidol generally failed to alter the firing rate of amygdaloid neurons, 20.0 mg/kg clozapine typically produced a prolonged increase in activity. Similarly, clozapine, but not haloperidol, reversed the depression of firing rate produced by 1.0 mg/kg d-amphetamine. The results suggest that neurons in the amygdaloid complex are more responsive to antipsychotic drugs devoid of extrapyramidal side effects than to antipsychotics which elicit parkinsonian-like motor dysfunctions.},

However, reinforcement learning models, such as the temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) model, treat extinction as an unlearning of associated value and are thus unable to capture renewal. TDRL models are based on the hypothesis that dopamine carries a reward prediction error signal; these models predict reward by driving that reward error to zero. The authors construct a TDRL model that can accommodate extinction and renewal through two simple processes: (a) a TDRL process that learns the value of situation-action pairs and (b) a situation recognition process that categorizes the observed cues into situations. This model has implications for dysfunctional states, including relapse after addiction and problem gambling.},

  abstract    = {Theta rhythms are behaviorally relevant electrical oscillations in the mammalian brain, particularly the hippocampus. In many cases, theta oscillations are shaped by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that are driven by glutamatergic and/or cholinergic inputs. Here we show that hippocampal theta rhythm IPSPs induced in the CA1 region by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors independent of all glutamate receptors can be briefly interrupted by action potential-induced, retrograde endocannabinoid release. Theta IPSPs can be recorded in CA1 pyramidal cell somata surgically isolated from CA3, subiculum, and even from their own apical dendrites. These results suggest that perisomatic-targeting interneurons whose output is subject to inhibition by endocannabinoids are the likely source of theta IPSPs. Interneurons having these properties include the cholecystokinin-containing cells. Simultaneous recordings from pyramidal cell pairs reveal synchronous theta-frequency IPSPs in neighboring pyramidal cells, suggesting that these IPSPs may help entrain or modulate small groups of pyramidal cells.},

  abstract    = {Biphasic effects of cannabinoids have been shown in processes such as feeding behavior, motor activity, motivational processes and anxiety responses. Using two different tests for the characterization of anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus-maze and holeboard), we first identified in wild-type C57BL/6N mice, two doses of the synthetic CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist CP-55,940 with anxiolytic (1 μg/kg) and anxiogenic properties (50 μg/kg), respectively. To clarify the role of CB1 receptors in this biphasic effect, both doses were applied to two different conditional CB1 receptor knockout (KO) mouse lines, GABA-CB1-KO (CB1 receptor inactivation in forebrain GABAergic neurons) and Glu-CB1-KO (CB1 receptor inactivation in cortical glutamatergic neurons). We found that the anxiolytic-like effects of the low dose of cannabinoids are mediated via the CB1 receptor on cortical glutamatergic terminals, because this anxiolytic-like response was abrogated only in Glu-CB1-KO mice. On the contrary, the CB1 receptor on the GABAergic terminals is required to induce an anxiogenic-like effect under a high-dose treatment because of the fact that this effect was abolished specifically in GABA-CB1-KO mice. These experiments were carried out in both sexes, and no differences occurred with the doses tested in the mutant mice. Interestingly, the positive allosteric modulation of GABA(B) receptor with GS-39783 was found to largely abrogate the anxiogenic-like effect of the high dose of CP-55,940. Our results shed new light in further understanding the biphasic effects of cannabinoids at the molecular level and, importantly, pave the way for the development of novel anxiolytic cannabinoid drugs, which may have favorable effect profiles targeting the CB1 receptor on glutamatergic terminals.},

  abstract    = {Cholinergic neuromodulation of hippocampal circuitry promotes network oscillations and facilitates learning and memory through cellular actions on both excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Despite widespread recognition that neurochemical content discriminates between functionally distinct interneuron populations, there has been no systematic examination of whether neurochemically distinct interneuron classes undergo differential cholinergic neuromodulation in the hippocampus. Using GFP transgenic mice that enable the visualization of perisomatically targeting parvalbumin-positive (PV+) or cholecystokinin-positive (CCK+) basket cells (BCs), we tested the hypothesis that neurochemically distinct interneuron populations are differentially engaged by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activation. Cholinergic fiber activation revealed that CCK BCs were more sensitive to synaptic release of ACh than PV BCs. In response to depolarizing current steps, mAChR activation of PV BCs and CCK BCs also elicited distinct cholinergic response profiles, differing in mAChR-induced changes in action potential (AP) waveform, firing frequency, and intrinsic excitability. In contrast to PV BCs, CCK BCs exhibited a mAChR-induced afterdepolarization (mADP) that was frequency and activity-dependent. Pharmacological, molecular, and loss-of-function data converged on the presence of M3 mAChRs in distinguishing CCK BCs from PV BCs. Firing frequency of CCK BCs was controlled through M3 mAChRs but PV BC excitability was altered solely through M1 mAChRs. Finally, upon mAChR activation, glutamatergic transmission enhanced cellular excitability preferentially in CCK BCs but not in PV BCs. Our findings demonstrate that cell type-specific cholinergic specializations are present on neurochemically distinct interneuron subtypes in the hippocampus, revealing an organizing principle that cholinergic neuromodulation depends critically on neurochemical identity.},

  abstract  = {Based on anatomical and biochemical observations a role of glutamate in schizophrenia has been postulated. In the present work we have investigated the gene expression for two families of {NMDA} receptor subunits {(NR-1} and {NR-2)} following acute and chronic treatment with typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine) antipsychotic drug {(APD)} in rats. A single injection of the two drugs elicited a significant increase in the {mRNA} levels of {NR-2B} in the nucleus accumbens, whereas only haloperidol was able to elevate {NR-2A} and {NR-2B} in the hippocampus. Following a 21 day treatment, significant differences in the regulatory pattern of {NMDA-R} subunits were observed. Haloperidol increased their {mRNA} levels in striatum whereas clozapine, consistent with its relatively weaker influence on nigro-striatal dopamine function, did not change the expression of {NR} subunits in this region. Both {APD's} were able to decrease the expression of {NR-2} subunits in the hypothalamus, but only clozapine was capable of reducing {NR-2C} in frontal cortex and accumbens. The regulation of {NMDA-R} subunits in specific brain regions may represent a novel and important mechanism through which {APD's} exert some of their effects on brain function.},

However, the anatomical organization of the neuronal substrates that express 2-AG/CB1 signaling system-related molecules associated with selective Ca(2+)-binding proteins (CaBPs) is still unknown. For this purpose, we used double-label immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy for the characterization of the expression of the 2-AG/CB1 signaling system (CB1 receptor, DAGLα, MAGL, and FAAH) and the CaBPs calbindin D28k, calretinin, and parvalbumin in the rat hippocampus. CB1, DAGLα, and MAGL labeling was mainly localized in fibers and neuropil, which were differentially organized depending on the hippocampal CaBPs-expressing cells. CB(+) 1 fiber terminals localized in all hippocampal principal cell layers were tightly attached to calbindin(+) cells (granular and pyramidal neurons), and calretinin(+) and parvalbumin(+) interneurons. DAGLα neuropil labeling was selectively found surrounding calbindin(+) principal cells in the dentate gyrus and CA1, and in the calretinin(+) and parvalbumin(+) interneurons in the pyramidal cell layers of the CA1/3 fields. MAGL(+) terminals were only observed around CA1 calbindin(+) pyramidal cells, CA1/3 calretinin(+) interneurons and CA3 parvalbumin(+) interneurons localized in the pyramidal cell layers. Interestingly, calbindin(+) pyramidal cells expressed FAAH specifically in the CA1 field. The identification of anatomically related-neuronal substrates that expressed 2-AG/CB1 signaling system and selective CaBPs should be considered when analyzing the cannabinoid signaling associated with hippocampal functions.},

In particular, the modality by which hippocampal place cells contribute to spatial memory is debated. We found that administration of the cannabinoid receptor agonist CP55940 (2-[(1S,2R,5S)-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]-5-(2-methyloctan-2-yl)phenol) induced a profound and reversible behavioral deficit in the hippocampus-dependent delayed spatial alternation task. On the one hand, despite severe memory impairment, the location-dependent firing of CA1 hippocampal place cells remained mostly intact. On the other hand, both spike-timing coordination between place cells at the theta timescale and theta phase precession of spikes were reversibly reduced. These results raise the possibility that cannabinoids impair memory primarily by altering short-term temporal dynamics of hippocampal neurons. We hypothesize that precise temporal coordination of hippocampal neurons is necessary for guiding behavior in spatial memory tasks.},

Here we show that the cannabinoids Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and CP55940 decreased the power of theta, gamma and ripple oscillations in the hippocampus of head-restrained and freely moving rats. These effects were blocked by a CB1 antagonist. The decrease in theta power correlated with memory impairment in a hippocampus-dependent task. By simultaneously recording from large populations of single units, we found that CP55940 severely disrupted the temporal coordination of cell assemblies in short time windows (<100 ms) yet only marginally affected population firing rates of pyramidal cells and interneurons. The decreased power of local field potential oscillations correlated with reduced temporal synchrony but not with firing rate changes. We hypothesize that reduced spike timing coordination and the associated impairment of physiological oscillations are responsible for cannabinoid-induced memory deficits.},

  abstract    = {Calcium ions serve as intracellular messengers in 2 activities of hair cells: in conjunction with Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels, they produce the electrical resonance that tunes each cell to a specific frequency of stimulation, and they trigger the release of a chemical synaptic transmitter. Our experiments indicate that both of these functions are conducted within a region that extends a few hundred nanometers around each presynaptic active zone. In focal electrical recordings from the plasma membranes of isolated anuran hair cells, we found nearly all of a cell's Ca2+ channels and Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels clumped at a fixed ratio in an average of 20 clusters on the basolateral membrane surface. Because serial-section electron microscopy indicated that each hair cell has approximately 19 afferent synaptic contacts with a similar distribution upon its basolateral surface, we conclude that the channel clusters coincide with synaptic active zones. Ensemble-variance analysis of current fluctuations indicated that each cell has a total of approximately 1800 Ca2+ channels and approximately 700 Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels; if these are uniformly divided, we estimate that each channel cluster contains approximately 90 Ca2+ and approximately 40 Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy demonstrated an average of 133 large intramembrane particles in the presynaptic membrane at each active zone, an observation that suggests that the particles are the clustered channels. We used the K+ channel's sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ to assay the concentration of free Ca2+ in the presynaptic cytoplasm, which we found to vary between 10 microM and 1 mM over the physiological range of membrane potentials. The inferred concentrations agreed with the values predicted for free diffusion of Ca2+ away from Ca2+ channels scattered randomly within a 300-nm-diameter synaptic active zone. The close association among Ca2+ channels, Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels, and synaptic active zones is necessary both for the rapid activation of K+ currents required in electrical resonance and for the transmission at afferent synapses of information about the phases of high-frequency stimuli.},

  abstract  = {A central difficulty of brain modelling is to span the range of spatio-temporal scales from synapses to the whole brain. This paper overviews results from a recent model of the generation of brain electrical activity that incorporates both basic microscopic neurophysiology and large-scale brain anatomy to predict brain electrical activity at scales from a few tenths of a millimetre to the whole brain. This model incorporates synaptic and dendritic dynamics, nonlinearity of the firing response, axonal propagation and corticocortical and corticothalamic pathways. Its relatively few parameters measure quantities such as synaptic strengths, corticothalamic delays, synaptic and dendritic time constants, and axonal ranges, and are all constrained by independent physiological measurements. It reproduces quantitative forms of electroencephalograms seen in various states of arousal, evoked response potentials, coherence functions, seizure dynamics and other phenomena. Fitting model predictions to experimental data enables underlying physiological parameters to be inferred, giving a new non-invasive window into brain function that complements slower, but finer-resolution, techniques such as {fMRI.} Because the parameters measure physiological quantities relating to multiple scales, and probe deep structures such as the thalamus, this will permit the testing of a range of hypotheses about vigilance, cognition, drug action and brain function. In addition, referencing to a standardized database of subjects adds strength and specificity to characterizations obtained.},

Reduced cortical inhibition caused by a reduction of GABA neurotransmission (present in schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the spontaneous firing states of cortical networks, leading to a noise-induced jump to a high firing rate attractor state even in the absence of external inputs, contributing to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

  abstract    = {Cognitive disruption in schizophrenia is associated with altered patterns of spatiotemporal interaction associated with multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands in cortex. In particular, changes in the generation of gamma (30-80 Hz) and beta2 (20-29 Hz) rhythms correlate with observed deficits in communication between different cortical areas. Aspects of these changes can be reproduced in animal models, most notably those involving acute or chronic reduction in glutamatergic synaptic communication mediated by N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In vitro electrophysiological and immunocytochemical approaches afforded by such animal models continue to reveal a great deal about the mechanisms underlying EEG rhythm generation and are beginning to uncover which basic molecular, cellular, and network phenomena may underlie their disruption in schizophrenia. Here we briefly review the evidence for changes in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) and glutamatergic function and address the problem of region specificity of changes with quantitative comparisons of effects of ketamine on gamma and beta2 rhythms in vitro. We conclude, from available evidence, that many observed changes in markers for GABAergic function in schizophrenia may be secondary to deficits in NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic activity. Furthermore, the broad range of changes in cortical dynamics seen in schizophrenia -- with contrasting effects seen in different brain regions and for different frequency bands -- may be more directly attributable to underlying deficits in glutamatergic neuronal communication rather than GABAergic inhibition alone.},

  abstract    = {Reduced amplitudes of auditory evoked P300 are a robust finding in schizophrenic patients, indicating deficient attentional resource allocation and active working memory. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), the main active constituent of Cannabis sativa, has been known to acutely impair cognitive abilities in several domains, particularly in memory and attention. Given the psychotic-like effects of Delta9-THC, a cannabinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia has been proposed. This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study investigated the acute effects of cannabinoids on P300 amplitude in 20 healthy volunteers (age 28.2+/-3.1 years, 10 male) by comparing Delta9-THC and standardized cannabis extract containing Delta9-THC and cannabidiol (CBD). P300 waves were recorded during a choice reaction task. As expected, Delta9-THC revealed a significant reduction of P300 amplitude at midline frontal, central, and parietal electrodes. CBD has been known to abolish many of the psychotropic effects of Delta9-THC, but, unexpectedly, failed to demonstrate a reversal of Delta9-THC-induced P300 reduction. Moreover, there were no correlations between cannabinoid plasma concentrations and P300 parameters. These data suggest that Delta(9)-THC may lead to acute impairment of attentional functioning and working memory. It can be speculated whether the lack of effect of CBD may be due to an insufficient dose used or to an involvement of neurotransmitter systems in P300 generation which are not influenced by CBD.},

  abstract    = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a widely studied neurodevelopmental disorder. It is a highly heterogeneous condition, encompassing different types of expression. The predominantly inattentive type is the most prevalent and the most stable over the lifetime, yet it is the least-studied presentation. To increase understanding of its cognitive profile, 29 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder of predominantly inattentive type (ADHD-I) and 29 matched controls, aged 7-15 years, had their attentional abilities assessed through the Conners' continuous performance test. Diffusion tensor imaging data were collected for all of the participants using a 3.0-T MRI system. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were obtained for 20 fiber tracts, and brain-behavior correlations were calculated for 42 of the children. The ADHD-I children differed significantly from the typically developing (TD) children with respect to attentional measures, such as the ability to maintain response-time consistency throughout the task (Hit RT SE and Variability), vigilance (Hit RT ISI and Hit RT ISI SE), processing speed (Hit RT), selective attention (Omissions), sustained attention (Hit RT Block Change), error profile (Response Style), and inhibitory control (Perseverations). Evidence of significant differences between the ADHD-I and the TD participants was not found with respect to the mean FA values in the fiber tracts analyzed. Moderate and strong correlations between performance on the attention indicators and the tract-average FA values were found for the ADHD-I group. Our results contribute to a better characterization of the attentional profile of ADHD-I individuals and suggest that in children and adolescents with ADHD-I, attentional performance is mainly associated with the white matter structure of the long associative fibers that connect anterior-posterior brain areas.},

  abstract    = {The psychotomimetic effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) in healthy humans and their ability to exacerbate psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients have promoted a view of schizophrenia as being related to altered glutamatergic neurotransmission.This prompted us and others to develop animal models for psychosis based on a glutamatergic approach. Pharmacological induction of a state of impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission based on chronic, low-dose application of MK-801, a highly selective noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, revealed marked parallels between schizophrenia and our animal model.MK-801 altered the expression of NR1 splice variants and NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor in a pattern partially resembling the alterations detected in schizophrenia. Ultrastructurally, the number of gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)ergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons was relatively decreased, a finding which again parallels observations in post mortem brain from schizophrenic patients. As a functional consequence, local inhibition of pyramidal cells which is largely mediated by recurrent axon collaterals, originating from GABAergic interneurons, was altered. Not unexpectedly, these animals showed cognitive deficits resembling findings in schizophrenic humans.These convergent lines of evidence suggest that our approach has a significant potential of serving as a model of the pathobiology of several aspects of psychosis and consequently could contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies.},

Although these compounds have efficacy in in vivo rodent models of cognition, depression, and Parkinson's disease, little is known about biochemical pathways activated by these agents. Given the well established regulation of the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway by excitatory neurotransmission, the current study characterized AMPA receptor potentiator-mediated cGMP response in mouse cerebellum. Acute treatment by both LY404187 and LY503430 [2.0, 5.0, or 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)] elevated basal cerebellar cGMP levels in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with the noncompetitive, allosteric AMPA receptor-selective antagonist 7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine-7-carboxamide, 5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-N,8-dimethyl-monohydrochloride-(9CI) (GYKI 53655) [3.0 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)], completely blocked the effect of LY404187, demonstrating that activation of AMPA receptors induces cGMP levels. Interestingly, pretreatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) open channel blocker dizocilpine (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.p.) also abolished the AMPA receptor potentiator-mediated cGMP accumulation, indicating that activation of AMPA receptors leads to NMDA receptor-mediated transmission involved in cGMP regulation. Pharmacological augmentation of the endogenous glutamate tone via the alkaloid harmaline (20-60 mg/kg i.p.) synergized with AMPA potentiator activity and provided further direct evidence of in vivo allosteric activation of AMPA receptors by LY404187. The synergism between harmaline and LY404187 was specific, since cGMP accumulation induced by foot-shock stress was not augmented by the AMPA receptor potentiator. Taken together, these data indicate that the cGMP system may play an important role in pharmacological efficacy of the biarylpropylsulfonamide class of AMPA receptor potentiators.},

  abstract    = {The endocannabinoid system is widespread throughout the central nervous system and its type 1 receptor (CB1) plays a crucial role in preventing the neurotoxicity caused by activation of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Indeed, it is the activity of NMDARs themselves that provides the demands on the endogenous cannabinoids in order to control their calcium currents. Therefore, a physiological role of this system is to maintain NMDAR activity within safe limits, thereby protecting neural cells from excitotoxicity. Thus, cannabinoids may be able to control NMDAR overactivation-related neural dysfunctions; however, the major obstacles to the therapeutic utilization of these compounds are their psychotropic effects and negative influence on cognitive performance. Studies in humans have indicated that abuse of smoked cannabis can promote psychosis and even circumstantially precipitate symptoms of schizophrenia, although the latter appears to require a prior vulnerability in the individual. It is possible that cannabinoids provoke psychosis/schizophrenia reflecting a mechanism common to neuroprotection: the reduction of NMDAR activity. Cannabinoids are proposed to produce such effect by reducing the pre-synaptic release of glutamate or interfering with post-synaptic NMDAR-regulated signaling pathways. The efficacy of such control requires the endocannabinoid system to apply its negative influence in a manner that is proportional to the strength of NMDAR signaling. Thus, cannabinoids acting at the wrong time or exerting an inappropriate influence on their receptors may cause NMDAR hypofunction. The purpose of the present review is to draw the attention of the reader to the newly described functional and physical CB1-NMDAR association, which may elucidate the scenario required for the rapid and efficacious control of NMDAR activity. Whether alterations in these mechanisms may increase NMDAR hypofunction leading to vulnerability to schizophrenia will be outlined.},

  abstract    = {Through the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), the endocannabinoid system plays a physiological role in maintaining the activity of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor within harmless limits. The influence of cannabinoids must be proportional to the stimulus in order to prevent NMDAR overactivation or exaggerated hypofunction that may precipitate symptoms of psychosis. In this framework, the recently reported association of CB1s with NMDARs, which mediates the reduction of cannabinoid analgesia promoted by NMDAR antagonism, could also support the precipitation of schizophrenia brought about by the abuse of smoked cannabis, mostly among vulnerable individuals. Accordingly, we have investigated this possibility using neuroprotection and analgesia as reporters of the CB1-NMDAR connection. We found that the Sigma 1 receptor (σ1R) acts as a safety switch, releasing NMDARs from the influence of CB1s and thereby avoiding glutamate hypofunction. In σ1R(-/-) mice the activity of NMDARs increases and cannot be regulated by cannabinoids, and NMDAR antagonism produces no effect on cannabinoid analgesia. In wild-type mice, ligands of the σ1R did not affect the CB1-NMDAR regulatory association, however, experimental NMDAR hypofunction enabled σ1R antagonists to release NMDARs from the negative control of CB1s. Of the σ1R antagonists tested, their order of activity was: S1RA > BD1047 ≫ NE100 = BD1063, although SKF10047, PRE-084 and (+)pentazocine were inactive yet able to abolish the effect of S1RA in this paradigm. Thus, the σ1R controls the extent of CB1-NMDAR interaction and its failure might constitute a vulnerability factor for cannabis abuse, potentially precipitating schizophrenia that might otherwise be induced later in time by the endogenous system.},

  abstract    = {Overactivation of glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) increases the cytosolic concentrations of calcium and zinc, which significantly contributes to neural death. Since cannabinoids prevent the NMDAR-mediated increase in cytosolic calcium, we investigated whether they also control the rise of potentially toxic free zinc ions, as well as the processes implicated in this phenomenon.The cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CNR1) and NMDARs are cross-regulated in different regions of the nervous system. Cannabinoids abrogated the stimulation of the nitric oxide-zinc pathway by NMDAR, an effect that required the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1). Conversely, NMDAR antagonism reduced the analgesia promoted by the CNR1 agonist WIN55,212-2 and impaired its capacity to internalize CNR1s. At the cell surface, CNR1s co-immunoprecipitated with the NR1 subunits of NMDARs, an association that diminished after the administration of NMDA in vivo or as a consequence of neuropathic overactivation of NMDARs, both situations in which cannabinoids do not control NMDAR activity. Under these circumstances, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) restored the association between CNR1s and NR1 subunits, and cannabinoids regained control over NMDAR activity. Notably, CNR1 and NR1 associated poorly in HINT1(-/-) mice, in which there was little cross-regulation between these receptors.The CNR1 can regulate NMDAR function when the receptor is coupled to HINT1. Thus, internalization of CNR1s drives the co-internalization of the NR1 subunits, neutralizing the overactivation of NMDARs.Cannabinoids require the HINT1 protein to counteract the toxic effects of NMDAR-mediated NO production and zinc release. This study situates the HINT1 protein at the forefront of cannabinoid protection against NMDAR-mediated brain damage.},

Lightly-stained cells were observed throughout the spinal cord gray matter. The DRG also showed cells and fibers labelled for CB1 receptors. Labelled fibers were observed in both dorsal and ventral roots as well as in peripheral nerves.The presence of CB1 receptors in the DRG, the dorsal root, and the dorsal horn is in accordance with the analgesic effects of cannabinoids. The presence of labelled cells and fibers in the ventral horn and ventral root provides a substrate for cannabinoid-induced muscle relaxant and antispastic effects.},

  abstract    = {The levels of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the basal ganglia are the highest in the brain, comparable to the levels of dopamine receptors, a major transmitter in the basal ganglia. This localization of receptors is consistent with the profound effects on motor function exerted by cannabinoids. The output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), apparently lack intrinsic cannabinoid receptors. Rather, the receptors are located on afferent terminals, the striatum being the major source. Cannabinoids blocked the inhibitory action of the striatal input in the SNr. Furthermore, cannabinoids blocked the excitatory effect of stimulation of the subthalamic input to the SNr revealing, along with data from in situ hybridization studies, that this input is another likely source of cannabinoid receptors to the SNr. Similar actions of cannabinoids were observed in the GP. Behavioral studies further revealed that the action of cannabinoids differs depending upon which input to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia is active. The inhibitory striatal input is quiescent and the cannabinoid action is observable only upon stimulation of the striatum, while the noticeable effect of cannabinoids under basal conditions would be on the tonically active subthalamic input. These data suggest that the recently discovered endogenous cannabinergic system exerts a major modulatory action in the basal ganglia by its ability to block both the major excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the SNr and GP.},

  abstract  = {In this review some of the recent work carried out in our laboratory concerning the functional role of GABAergic signalling at immature mossy fibres (MF)-CA3 principal cell synapses has been highlighted. While in adulthood MF, the axons of dentate gyrus granule cells release onto CA3 principal cells and interneurons glutamate, early in postnatal life they release GABA, which exerts into targeted cells a depolarizing and excitatory action. We found that GABAA-mediated postsynaptic currents (MF-GPSCs) exhibited a very low probability of release, were sensitive to L-AP4, a group III metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, and revealed short-term frequency-dependent facilitation. Moreover, MF-GPSCs were down regulated by presynaptic GABAB and kainate receptors, activated by spillover of GABA from MF terminals and by glutamate present in the extracellular medium, respectively. Activation of these receptors contributed to the low release probability and in some cases to synapses silencing. By pairing calcium transients, associated with network-driven giant depolarizing potentials or GDPs (a hallmark of developmental networks thought to represent a primordial form of synchrony between neurons), generated by the synergistic action of glutamate and GABA with MF activation increased the probability of GABA release and caused the conversion of silent synapses into conductive ones suggesting that GDPs act as coincident detector signals for enhancing synaptic efficacy. Finally, to compare the relative strength of CA3 pyramidal cell output in relation to their MF glutamatergic or GABAergic inputs in adulthood or in postnatal development, respectively, a realistic model was constructed taking into account different biophysical properties of these synapses.},

  abstract    = {Activation of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) decreases GABA and glutamate release in cortical and subcortical regions, with complex outcomes on cortical network activity. To date there have been few attempts to disentangle the region- and cell-specific mechanisms underlying the effects of cannabinoids on cortical network activity in vivo. Here we addressed this issue by combining in vivo electrophysiological recordings with local and systemic pharmacological manipulations in conditional mutant mice lacking CB1R expression in different neuronal populations. First we report that cannabinoids induce hypersynchronous thalamocortical oscillations while decreasing the amplitude of faster cortical oscillations. Then we demonstrate that CB1R at striatonigral synapses (basal ganglia direct pathway) mediate the thalamocortical hypersynchrony, whereas activation of CB1R expressed in cortical glutamatergic neurons decreases cortical synchrony. Finally we show that activation of CB1 expressed in cortical glutamatergic neurons limits the cannabinoid-induced thalamocortical hypersynchrony. By reporting that CB1R activations in cortical and subcortical regions have contrasting effects on cortical synchrony, our study bridges the gap between cellular and in vivo network effects of cannabinoids. Incidentally, the thalamocortical hypersynchrony we report suggests a potential mechanism to explain the sensory "high" experienced during recreational consumption of marijuana.},

  abstract    = {Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors have emerged as potential treatments for schizophrenia due to their potentiation of NMDA receptor activity by modulating the local concentrations of the NMDA co-agonist glycine. [18F]MK-6577 is a potent and selective GlyT1 inhibitor PET tracer. Although differences in ligand kinetics can be expected between non-human primates and humans, the tracer pre-clinical evaluation can provide valuable information supporting protocol design and quantification in the clinical space. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the in vivo kinetics of [18F]MK-6577 in rhesus monkey brain. Additionally, a method for estimating the tracer input function from the tracer brain tissue kinetics and venous sampling was validated. This technique was applied for determination of the dose-occupancy relationship of a GlyT1 inhibitor in monkey brain.Compartmental and Logan graphical analysis were utilized for quantification of the [18F]MK-6577 binding using the measured tracer arterial input function. The stability of the tracer volume of distribution relative to scan length was assessed. The proposed model-based input function method takes advantage of the agreement between the tracer concentration in arterial and venous plasma from ~5 min. The approach estimates the initial peak of the input curve by adding a gamma like function term to the measured venous curve. The parameters of the model function were estimated by simultaneously fitting several brain time activity curves to a compartmental model.Good agreement was found between the model-based and the measured arterial plasma curve and the corresponding distribution volumes. The Logan analysis was the preferred method of analysis providing reliable and stable volume of distribution and occupancy results using a 90 and possibly 60 min scan length.The model-based input function method and Logan analysis are well suited for quantification of [18F]MK-6577 binding and GlyT1 occupancy in monkey brain.},

  abstract    = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy with hippocampus as the usual site of origin. The CA3 subfield of hippocampus is reported to have a low epileptic threshold and hence initiates the disorder in patients with TLE. This study computationally investigates how impaired dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the vulnerable CA3 subfield leads to generation of epileptic activity. A model of CA3 subfield consisting of 800 pyramidal cells, 200 basket cells (BC) and 200 Oriens-Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) interneurons was used. The dendritic inhibition provided by O-LM interneurons is reported to be selectively impaired in some TLEs. A step-wise approach is taken to investigate how alterations in network connectivity lead to generation of epileptic patterns. Initially, dendritic inhibition alone was reduced, followed by an increase in the external inputs received at the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells, and finally additional changes were made at the synapses between all neurons in the network. In the first case, when the dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells alone was reduced, the local field potential activity changed from a theta-modulated gamma pattern to a prominently gamma frequency pattern. In the second case, in addition to this reduction of dendritic inhibition, with a simultaneous large increase in the external excitatory inputs received by pyramidal cells, the basket cells entered a state of depolarization block, causing the network to generate a typical ictal activity pattern. In the third case, when the dendritic inhibition onto the pyramidal cells was reduced and changes were simultaneously made in synaptic connectivity between all neurons in the network, the basket cells were again observed to enter depolarization block. In the third case, impairment of dendritic inhibition required to generate an ictal activity pattern was lesser than the two previous cases. Moreover, the ictal like activity began earlier in the third case. Hence, our study suggests that greater synaptic plasticity occurring in the whole network due to increase in reception of external excitatory inputs (due to impaired dendritic inhibition) makes the network more susceptible to generation of epileptic activity.},

This simulation environment enables the model-based inference of neurophysiological mechanisms across different brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic neuroimaging signals including functional MRI (fMRI), EEG and MEG. Researchers from different backgrounds can benefit from an integrative software platform including a supporting framework for data management (generation, organization, storage, integration and sharing) and a simulation core written in Python. TVB allows the reproduction and evaluation of personalized configurations of the brain by using individual subject data. This personalization facilitates an exploration of the consequences of pathological changes in the system, permitting to investigate potential ways to counteract such unfavorable processes. The architecture of TVB supports interaction with MATLAB packages, for example, the well known Brain Connectivity Toolbox. TVB can be used in a client-server configuration, such that it can be remotely accessed through the Internet thanks to its web-based HTML5, JS, and WebGL graphical user interface. TVB is also accessible as a standalone cross-platform Python library and application, and users can interact with the scientific core through the scripting interface IDLE, enabling easy modeling, development and debugging of the scientific kernel. This second interface makes TVB extensible by combining it with other libraries and modules developed by the Python scientific community. In this article, we describe the theoretical background and foundations that led to the development of TVB, the architecture and features of its major software components as well as potential neuroscience applications.},

  abstract    = {Regular, "moderate", physical exercise is an established non-pharmacological form of treatment for depressive disorders. Brain lateralization has a significant role in the progress of depression. External stimuli such as various stressors or exercise influence the higher functions of the brain (cognition and affect). These effects often do not follow a linear course. Therefore, nonlinear dynamics seem best suited for modeling many of the phenomena, and putative global pathways in the brain, attributable to such external influences.The general hypothesis presented here considers only the nonlinear aspects of the effects produced by "moderate" exercise and "chronic" stressors, but does not preclude the possibility of linear responses. In reality, both linear and nonlinear mechanisms may be involved in the final outcomes. The well-known neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (D) and norepinephrine (NE) all have various receptor subtypes. The article hypothesizes that 'Stress' increases the activity/concentration of some particular subtypes of receptors (designated nts) for each of the known (and unknown) neurotransmitters in the right anterior (RA) and left posterior (LP) regions (cortical and subcortical) of the brain, and has the converse effects on a different set of receptor subtypes (designated nth). In contrast, 'Exercise' increases nth activity/concentration and/or reduces nts activity/concentration in the LA and RP areas of the brain. These effects may be initiated by the activation of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) (among others) in exercise and its suppression in stress.On the basis of this hypothesis, a better understanding of brain neurodynamics might be achieved by considering the oscillations caused by single neurotransmitters acting on their different receptor subtypes, and the temporal pattern of recruitment of these subtypes. Further, appropriately designed and planned experiments will not only corroborate such theoretical models, but also shed more light on the underlying brain dynamics.},

  abstract    = {Finding methods to describe subcortical processes assisting cognition is an important concern for clinical neuropsychological practice. In this study, we reviewed the literature concerning the relationship between a neuropsychological instrument and the underlying neural substructure. We examined evidence indicating that one of the oldest neuropsychological tests still in use, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), includes reliable indicators of hippocampal integrity. We reviewed studies investigating the neural structures underlying seven tasks generated by the RAVLT, from the perspective of whether the performance of these tasks is dependent on the hippocampus. We found support for our hypothesis in five cases: learning capacity, proactive interference, immediate recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition. No support for our hypothesis was found with regard to short-term memory and retroactive interference. The RAVLT appears to be a reliable tool for assessing the integrity of the hippocampus and for the early detection of dysfunction. There is a need for such assessments, due to the crucial role of the hippocampus in cognition, for instance, in terms of predicting future outcomes.},

  abstract    = {Neural correlates of control mechanisms in human working memory are discussed at two levels in this review: (i) at 'item level', where in multi-item working memory information needs to be organized into sequential memory representations, and (ii) at a 'process level', indicating the integration and control of a variety of cognitive functions involved in working memory, independent of item representations per se. It will be discussed that at both levels electroencephalographic theta activity is responsible for control of working memory functions. On item level, exact phase coding, e.g., approached by coupling between theta and gamma oscillations or phase resetting of theta frequency, is suggested to integrate information into working memory representations. At process level interregional theta synchronization is discussed to integrate brain structures necessary for working memory. When discussing the specificity of theta activity for control of working memory processes it will be suggested that theta oscillations might play an important general integrative role in organization of brain activity. And as working memory often involves a variety of cognitive processes which need to be coordinated there is particular need for an integrative brain mechanism like theta activity as suggested in this review.},

  abstract    = {Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) refers to an impairment of attention in hypoactive-appearing individuals that first presents in childhood. At this time, it exists only as a research entity that has yet to debut in official diagnostic taxonomies. However, it seems likely that a constellation of characteristic features of SCT may form the criteria for a newly defined childhood disorder in the foreseeable future, provided limitations in the extant findings can be addressed by future research. Most clinicians who assess and treat cases of attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have likely seen and treated someone who falls within the parameters for SCT. This article outlines the history of SCT and reviews the current understanding of the disorder, how it is distinguishable from and similar to other attention disorders, and what future directions research and treatment may take. Based on this review and their clinical experience, the authors conjecture that SCT is probably distinct from ADHD rather than being an ADHD subtype, although there is notable overlap with the ADHD predominantly inattentive and combined presentations.},

The present study examines the extent to which these cognitive deficits are generalized across domains, potential moderator variables, and whether the pattern of cognitive findings reported in schizophrenia has remained consistent over time and across cultural and geographic variation.Relevant publications from 2006 to 2011 were identified through keyword searches in PubMed and an examination of reference lists. Studies were included if they (1) compared the cognitive performance of adult schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, (2) based schizophrenia diagnoses on contemporary diagnostic criteria, (3) reported information sufficient to permit effect size calculation, (4) were reported in English, and (5) reported data for neuropsychological tests falling into at least 3 distinct cognitive domains. A set of 100 non-overlapping studies was identified, and effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated for each cognitive variable.Consistent with earlier analyses, patients with schizophrenia scored significantly lower than controls across all cognitive tests and domains (grand mean effect size, g=-1.03). Patients showed somewhat larger impairments in the domains of processing speed (g=-1.25) and episodic memory (g=-1.23). Our results also showed few inconsistencies when grouped by geographic region.The present study extends findings from 1980 to 2006 of a substantial, generalized cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, demonstrating that this finding has remained robust over time despite changes in assessment instruments and alterations in diagnostic criteria, and that it manifests similarly in different regions of the world despite linguistic and cultural differences.},

Magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem investigations revealed deficits in the temporoprefrontal neuronal circuit. Decreased oligodendrocyte numbers and expression of oligodendrocyte genes and synaptic proteins may contribute to disturbances of micro- and macro-circuitry in the pathophysiology of the disease. Functional connectivity between cortical areas can be investigated with high temporal resolution using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In this review, disconnectivity between different cortical areas in schizophrenia patients is described. The specificity and the neurobiological origin of these connectivity deficits and the relation to the symptom complex of schizophrenia and the glutamatergic and GABAergic system are discussed.},

  abstract    = {To determine if NMDA receptor alterations are present in the cerebellum in schizophrenia, we measured NMDA receptor binding and gene expression of the NMDA receptor subunits in a post-mortem study of elderly patients with schizophrenia and non-affected subjects. Furthermore, we assessed influence of genetic variation in the candidate gene neuregulin-1 (NRG1) on the expression of the NMDA receptor in an exploratory study. Post-mortem samples from the cerebellar cortex of ten schizophrenic patients were compared with nine normal subjects. We investigated NMDA receptor binding by receptor autoradiography and gene expression of the NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C and NR2D by in situ hybridization. For the genetic study, we genotyped the NRG1 polymorphism rs35753505 (SNP8NRG221533). Additionally, we treated rats with the antipsychotics haloperidol or clozapine and assessed cerebellar NMDA receptor binding and gene expression of subunits to examine the effects of antipsychotic treatment. Gene expression of the NR2D subunit was increased in the right cerebellum of schizophrenic patients compared to controls. Individuals carrying at least one C allele of rs35753505 (SNP8NRG221533) showed decreased expression of the NR2C subunit in the right cerebellum, compared to individuals homozygous for the T allele. Correlation with medication parameters and the animal model revealed no treatment effects. In conclusion, increased NR2D expression results in a hyperexcitable NMDA receptor suggesting an adaptive effect due to receptor hypofunction. The decreased NR2C expression in NRG1 risk variant may cause a deficit in NMDA receptor function. This supports the hypothesis of an abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission in the right cerebellum in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis use is associated with a spectrum of effects including euphoria, relaxation, anxiety, perceptual alterations, paranoia, and impairments in attention and memory. Cannabis is made up of approximately 80 different cannabinoid compounds, which have synergistic or antagonistic effects on the principle active ingredient in cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The net overall effect of cannabis is thought to be related to the ratio of its composite constituents; in particular, the ratio of THC to cannabidiol (CBD). Since cannabinoids induce subjective and cognitive changes that share qualitative similarities with schizophrenia, cannabinoids have been used to model psychosis. Some limitations of cannabinoid models of psychosis include the relatively high variability in experiences between different individuals, the potential for inducing unwanted effects, such as toxic psychosis in study subjects, and the lack of data showing that effective anti-psychotic treatments can reverse the behavioural and cognitive/motor effects of cannabinoids. Nabiximols (Sativex®) is an oromucosal spray containing THC and CBD in an approximate 1:1 ratio. While not extensively studied, most studies confirm that nabiximols, despite the different route of administration and presence of CBD, have similar or slightly reduced subjective/cognitive effects compared to similar doses of oral THC. While the presence of CBD may have utility in some models, it is likely that the concentrations are not high enough to meaningfully affect those aspects important for psychosis research. This review suggests that while it may present an alternative to the use of oral THC, oromucosal nabiximols may not present substantial advantages for use in psychosis research.},

In natural settings, important stimuli often occur in rhythmic streams, and when oscillations entrain to an input rhythm their high excitability phases coincide with events in the stream, effectively amplifying neuronal input responses. When operating in a 'rhythmic mode', attention can use these differential excitability states as a mechanism of selection by simply enforcing oscillatory entrainment to a task-relevant input stream. When there is no low-frequency rhythm that oscillations can entrain to, attention operates in a 'continuous mode', characterized by extended increase in gamma synchrony. We review the evidence for early sensory selection by oscillatory phase-amplitude modulations, its mechanisms and its perceptual and behavioral consequences.},

This improvement seems to have been a reduction of core psychotic symptoms in 3 of the 4 responders and not just nonspecific calming. There were no clinically significant adverse effects. These results complement the recent finding that the cannabinoid blocker rimonabant does not improve schizophrenic symptoms and suggest that the role of cannabinoids in psychosis may be more complex than previously thought. They open a possible new role for cannabinoids in the treatment of schizophrenia.},

  abstract   = {Clozapine has a remarkable efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and is one of the most effective antipsychotic drugs used today. The clinical effects of clozapine are suggested to be related to a unique interaction with a variety of receptor systems, including the glutamatergic receptors. Kynurenic acid {(KYNA)} is an endogenous blocker of alpha7 nicotinic receptors and a glutamate-receptor antagonist, preferentially blocking {N-methyl-D-aspartate} {(NMDA)} receptors. In the present in vivo electrophysiological study, changes in endogenous concentration of brain {KYNA} were utilized to analyze an interaction between clozapine and the glycine site of {NMDA} receptors. In control rats intravenously administered clozapine (0.078-10 mg/kg) increased the firing rate and the burst firing activity of dopamine {(DA)} neurons in the ventral tegmental area {(VTA).} Pretreatment with indomethacin (50 mg/kg, i.p., 1-3.5 h), a cyclooxygenase {(COX)-inhibitor} with a preferential selectivity for {COX-1}, which produced a significant elevation in brain {KYNA} levels, reversed the excitatory action of clozapine into an inhibitory response. In contrast, pretreatment with the {COX-2} selective inhibitor parecoxib (25 mg/kg, i.v., 1-1.5 h) decreased brain {KYNA} formation and furthermore, clearly potentiated the excitatory effect of clozapine. Our results show that endogenous levels of brain {KYNA} are of importance for the response of clozapine on {VTA} {DA} neurons. On the basis of the present data we propose that clozapine is able to interact with glutamatergic mechanisms, via actions at the {NMDA/glycine} receptor.},

  abstract  = {Under some conditions, synaptically released glutamate can exert long-range actions in the cortical microcircuitry. To what extent glutamate spillover leads to direct cross talk among individual synapses remains unclear. We recorded {NMDAR-mediated} {EPSCs} in acute hippocampal slices at 35 degrees C by stimulating two independent pathways that converge on the same {CA1} pyramidal cell. Activation of a conditioning pathway in the presence of the use-dependent blocker dizocilpine maleate {(MK801)} resulted in partial {NMDA} receptor {(NMDAR)} blockade in the other, silent pathway. This was accompanied by an increase in the rise time of the {EPSCs} in the conditioning (although not the silent) pathway, implying an increase in diffusional distance from release site to {NMDARs.} We estimated that up to approximately 30\% of {NMDARs} contributing to {EPSCs} were activated by glutamate released from multiple synaptic sources; however, {NMDAR-mediated} synaptic cross talk was undetectable when {NR2B} subunit-containing receptors were blocked (but could be rescued by blocking glutamate uptake). We propose that {NR2B-containing} {NMDARs} can detect glutamate arising from multiple synapses, whereas {NR2A-containing} {NMDARs} only normally mediate direct synaptic transmission. These {NMDAR} isoforms thus play complementary roles in sensing global and local glutamate signals, respectively.},

  abstract    = {"K2" and "Spice" drugs (collectively hereafter referred to as Spice) represent a relatively new class of designer drugs that have recently emerged as popular alternatives to marijuana, otherwise characterized as "legal highs". These drugs are readily available on the Internet and sold in many head shops and convenience stores under the disguise of innocuous products like herbal blends, incense, or air fresheners. Although package labels indicate "not for human consumption", the number of intoxicated people presenting to emergency departments is dramatically increasing. The lack of validated and standardized human testing procedures and an endless supply of potential drugs of abuse are primary reasons why researchers find it difficult to fully characterize clinical consequences associated with Spice. While the exact chemical composition and toxicology of Spice remains to be determined, there is mounting evidence identifying several synthetic cannabinoids as causative agents responsible for psychoactive and adverse physical effects. This review provides updates of the legal status of common synthetic cannabinoids detected in Spice and analytical procedures used to test Spice products and human specimens collected under a variety of clinical circumstances. The pharmacological and toxicological consequences of synthetic cannabinoid abuse are also reviewed to provide a future perspective on potential short- and long-term implications.},

  abstract    = {The neuronal mechanisms underlying social withdrawal, one of the core negative symptoms of schizophrenia, are not well understood. Recent studies suggest an involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and, in particular, of negative symptoms. We used biochemical, pharmacological, and behavioral approaches to investigate the role played by the endocannabinoid system in social withdrawal induced by sub-chronic administration of phencyclidine (PCP). Pharmacological enhancement of endocannabinoid levels via systemic administration of URB597, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid degradation, reversed social withdrawal in PCP-treated rats via stimulation of CB1 receptors, but reduced social interaction in control animals through activation of a cannabinoid/vanilloid-sensitive receptor. In addition, the potent CB agonist CP55,940 reversed PCP-induced social withdrawal in a CB₁-dependent manner, whereas pharmacological blockade of CB₁ receptors by either AM251 or SR141716 reduced the time spent in social interaction in control animals. PCP-induced social withdrawal was accompanied by a decrease of anandamide (AEA) levels in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, and these deficits were reversed by URB597. As CB₁ receptors are predominantly expressed on GABAergic interneurons containing the anxiogenic peptide cholecystokinin (CCK), we also examined whether the PCP-induced social withdrawal resulted from deficient CB₁-mediated modulation of CCK transmission. The selective CCK2 antagonist LY225910 blocked both PCP- and AM251-induced social withdrawal, but not URB597 effect in control rats. Taken together, these findings indicate that AEA-mediated activation of CB₁ receptors is crucial for social interaction, and that PCP-induced social withdrawal results from deficient endocannabinoid transmission.},

Schizophrenia's strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.},

This study assessed whether the BDII could detect subtle cognitive impairment due to regular cannabis use by comparing 10 regular cannabis users and 10 healthy controls from the same community sources, matched for age, sex, and premorbid IQ. Subjects were also compared on measures of executive functioning, memory, and personality. Regular cannabis users were found to have significantly higher BDII scores for inverted images. This was not due to a problem in the primary processing of visual information, as there was no significant difference between the groups for depth perception of normal images. There was no relationship between BDII scores for inverted images and time since last dose, suggesting that the measured impairment of BDII more closely reflected chronic than acute effects of regular cannabis use. There were no significant differences between the groups for other neuropsychological measures of memory or executive function. A positive relationship was found between EPQ-R-psychoticism and cannabis, tobacco, and alcohol use. Cannabis users also used significantly larger amounts of alcohol. However, no relationship was found between BDII scores and drug use other than cannabis or psychoticism. Compared to the other neuropsychological tests used, the BDII appears to be a more sensitive tool for the detection of subtle impairments in visual information processing related to chronic cannabis use.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoids have been shown to alter time perception, but existing literature has several limitations. Few studies have included both time estimation and production tasks, few control for subvocal counting, most had small sample sizes, some did not record subjects' cannabis use, many tested only one dose, and used either oral or inhaled administration of Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), leading to variable pharmacokinetics, and some used whole-plant cannabis containing cannabinoids other than THC. Our study attempted to address these limitations.This study aims to characterize the acute effects of THC and frequent cannabis use on seconds-range time perception. THC was hypothesized to produce transient, dose-related time overestimation and underproduction. Frequent cannabis smokers were hypothesized to show blunted responses to these alterations.IV THC was administered at doses from 0.015 to 0.05 mg/kg to 44 subjects who participated in several double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover, placebo-controlled studies. Visual time estimation and production tasks in the seconds range were presented to subjects three times on each test day.All doses induced time overestimation and underproduction. Chronic cannabis use had no effect on baseline time perception. While infrequent/nonsmokers showed temporal overestimation at medium and high doses and temporal underproduction at all doses, frequent cannabis users showed no differences. THC effects on time perception were not dose related.A psychoactive dose of THC increases internal clock speed as indicated by time overestimation and underproduction. This effect is not dose related and is blunted in chronic cannabis smokers who did not otherwise have altered baseline time perception.},

  abstract    = {Recent advances in knowledge about cannabinoid receptor function have renewed interest in the association between cannabis and psychosis. Converging lines of evidence suggest that cannabinoids can produce a full range of transient schizophrenia-like positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Cannabinoids also produce some psychophysiological deficits also known to be present in schizophrenia. Also clear is that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. Increasing evidence suggests that early and heavy cannabis exposure may increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. The relationship between cannabis exposure and schizophrenia fulfills some, but not all, of the usual criteria for causality. However, most people who use cannabis do not develop schizophrenia, and many people diagnosed with schizophrenia have never used cannabis. Therefore, it is likely that cannabis exposure is a "component cause" that interacts with other factors to "cause" schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to do so alone. In the absence of known causes of schizophrenia, however, and the implications for public health policy should such a link be established the role of component causes such as cannabinoid exposure should remain a focus of further study. Finally, further work is necessary to identify the factors that underlie individual vulnerability to cannabinoid-related psychosis and to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying this risk.},

  abstract    = {Fronto-posterior networks have been implicated in various cognitive processes that are impaired in schizophrenia. This is the first study on time and frequency resolved fronto-posterior coherence during cognitive control in schizophrenia.We examined 16 schizophrenic/schizoaffective patients and 20 age-matched controls performing a choice-reaction task. Fronto-posterior coherence was analyzed for event-related increases with respect to the inter-trial interval. Furthermore, we compared the two groups for event-related coherence during the task-related time intervals which showed a significant coherence increase with respect to the inter-trial interval, as well as for absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval.Event-related coherence was significantly reduced in patients during time intervals (0-250 ms poststimulus) when controls showed significant event-related coherence increases. However, patients showed significantly higher absolute coherence during the inter-trial interval. These results pointed to differential deficits in fronto-posterior connectivity during the inter-trial interval and task-related conditions in schizophrenia.Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia might be driven by abnormal fronto-posterior communication. Task-related hypo-connectivity and inter-trial interval hyper-connectivity point to resource allocation deficits. The timing of cortico-cortical interactions during crucial task-related intervals may be impaired, while frontal and posterior areas may exhibit increased interactions between the trials.},

The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood, with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high-frequency oscillatory power (Wood et al., 2012) noted in animal studies. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition. This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans, which may underlie the anti-depressant actions of ketamine.},

Observational studies have found treatment with psychostimulants to be associated more closely with dimensions of some brain structures in typically developing children than in those found in treatment-naïve children with ADHD. Novel analytic approaches allow for greater precision in the definition of brain regions that are most compromised in ADHD, with meta-analyses highlighting compromise of the basal ganglia. Cortical changes, particularly in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortex, are also commonly reported, but with less consensus on the exact location of structural change. Anomalies in the shape of subcortical structures, specifically of the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and amygdala, implicate frontostriatal loops and the limbic system in the disorder. Finally, longitudinal data suggest that ADHD in childhood may be characterized by a delay in cortical maturation and that different clinical outcomes may be associated with different developmental trajectories in adolescence and beyond.},

Because these receptors are restricted to two distinct MSN populations, this postulate demands that synaptic plasticity be unidirectional in each cell type. Using brain slices from DA receptor transgenic mice, we show that this is not the case. Rather, DA plays complementary roles in these two types of MSN to ensure that synaptic plasticity is bidirectional and Hebbian. In models of Parkinson's disease, this system is thrown out of balance, leading to unidirectional changes in plasticity that could underlie network pathology and symptoms.},

  abstract    = {Some of the most compelling evidence supporting an association between cannabinoid agonists and psychosis comes from controlled laboratory studies in humans. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover laboratory studies demonstrate that cannabinoid agonists, including phytocannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids, produce a wide range of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms and psychophysiologic deficits in healthy human subjects that resemble the phenomenology of schizophrenia. These effects are time locked to drug administration, are dose related, and are transient and rarely necessitate intervention. The magnitude of effects is similar to the effects of ketamine but qualitatively distinct from other psychotomimetic drugs, including ketamine, amphetamine, and salvinorin A. Cannabinoid agonists have also been shown to transiently exacerbate symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia in laboratory studies. Patients with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than healthy control subjects to the acute behavioral and cognitive effects of cannabinoid agonists and experience transient exacerbation of symptoms despite treatment with antipsychotic medications. Furthermore, laboratory studies have failed to demonstrate any "beneficial" effects of cannabinoid agonists in individuals with schizophrenia-challenging the cannabis self-medication hypothesis. Emerging evidence suggests that polymorphisms of several genes related to dopamine metabolism (e.g., COMT, DAT1, and AKT1) may moderate the effects of cannabinoid agonists in laboratory studies. Cannabinoid agonists induce dopamine release, although the magnitude of release does not appear to be commensurate to the magnitude and spectrum of their acute psychotomimetic effects. Interactions between the endocannabinoid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate systems and their individual and interactive effects on neural oscillations provide a plausible mechanism underlying the psychotomimetic effects of cannabinoids.},

Although genetic factors contribute substantially to CAD risk, at present no well-established specific genetic risk factors for CAD have been elucidated.To report findings for DSM-IV CAD criteria from association analyses performed in large cohorts of African American and European American participants from 3 studies of substance use disorder genetics.This genome-wide association study for DSM-IV CAD criterion count was performed in 3 independent substance dependence cohorts (the Yale-Penn Study, Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment [SAGE], and International Consortium on the Genetics of Heroin Dependence [ICGHD]). A referral sample and volunteers recruited in the community and from substance abuse treatment centers included 6000 African American and 8754 European American participants, including some from small families. Participants from the Yale-Penn Study were recruited from 2000 to 2013. Data were collected for the SAGE trial from 1990 to 2007 and for the ICGHD from 2004 to 2009. Data were analyzed from January 2, 2013, to November 9, 2015.Criterion count for DSM-IV CAD.Among the 14 754 participants, 7879 were male, 6875 were female, and the mean (SD) age was 39.2 (10.2) years. Three independent regions with genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism associations were identified, considering the largest possible sample. These included rs143244591 (β = 0.54, P = 4.32 × 10-10 for the meta-analysis) in novel antisense transcript RP11-206M11.7;rs146091982 (β = 0.54, P = 1.33 × 10-9 for the meta-analysis) in the solute carrier family 35 member G1 gene (SLC35G1); and rs77378271 (β = 0.29, P = 2.13 × 10-8 for the meta-analysis) in the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 gene (CSMD1). Also noted was evidence of genome-level pleiotropy between CAD and major depressive disorder and for an association with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with schizophrenia risk. Several of the genes identified have functions related to neuronal calcium homeostasis or central nervous system development.These results are the first, to our knowledge, to identify specific CAD risk alleles and potential genetic factors contributing to the comorbidity of CAD with major depression and schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {The agranular cortex is an important landmark-anatomically, as the architectural flag of mammalian motor cortex, and historically, as a spur to the development of theories of localization of function. But why, exactly, do agranularity and motor function go together? To address this question, it should be noted that not only does motor cortex lack granular layer four, it also has a relatively thinner layer three. Therefore, it is the two layers which principally constitute the ascending pathways through the sensory (granular) cortex that have regressed in motor cortex: simply stated, motor cortex does not engage in serial reprocessing of incoming sensory data. But why should a granular architecture not be demanded by the downstream relay of motor instructions through the motor cortex? The scant anatomical evidence available regarding laminar patterns suggests that the pathways from frontal and premotor areas to the primary motor cortex actually bear a greater resemblance to the descending, or feedback connections of sensory cortex that avoid the granular layer. The action of feedback connections is generally described as "modulatory" at a cellular level, or "selective" in terms of systems analysis. By contrast, ascending connections may be labelled "driving" or "instructive". Where the motor cortex uses driving inputs, they are most readily identified as sensory signals instructing the visual location of targets and the kinaesthetic state of the body. Visual signals may activate motor concepts, e.g. "mirror neurons", and the motor plan must select the appropriate muscles and forces to put the plan into action, if the decision to move is taken. This, perhaps, is why "driving" motor signals might be inappropriate-the optimal selection and its execution are conditional upon both kinaesthetic and motivational factors. The argument, summarized above, is constructed in honour of Korbinian Brodmann's centenary, and follows two of the fundamental principles of his school of thought: that uniformities in cortical structure, and development imply global conservation of some aspects of function, whereas regional variations in architecture can be used to chart the "organs" of the cortex, and perhaps to understand their functional differences.},

Aspects of such learning can be probed with trace conditioning, during which an animal learns to associate events that are temporally distant from one another. For decades, we have known that the formation of so-called trace memories (in which one stimulus is associated with a second stimulus that is discontinuous and later in time) depends on the hippocampal formation. Recent findings indicate that the hippocampus is crucial for the initial acquisition of trace memories but not for their expression or long-term storage. More recent findings implicate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and awareness in the formation of trace memories.},

  abstract    = {A good deal of recent research has centered on the identification of biomarkers and endophenotypic measures of psychiatric illnesses using in vivo and in vitro studies. This is understandable, as these measures-as opposed to complex clinical phenotypes-may be more closely related to neurobiological and genetic vulnerabilities. However, instantiation of such biomarkers using computational models-in silico studies-has received less attention. This approach could become increasingly important, given the wealth of detailed information produced by recent basic neuroscience research, and increasing availability of high capacity computing platforms. The purpose of this review is to survey the current state of the art of research in this area. We discuss computational approaches to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, fragile X syndrome, and autism, and argue that this represents a promising, and underappreciated, research modality. In conclusion, we outline specific avenues for future research; also, potential uses of in silico models to conduct "virtual experiments" and to generate novel hypotheses, and as an aid in neuropsychiatric drug development are discussed.},

  abstract    = {A large number of cellular level abnormalities have been identified in the hippocampus of schizophrenic subjects. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how these pathologies interact at a system level to create clinical symptoms, and this has hindered the development of more effective antipsychotic medications. Using a 72-processor supercomputer, we created a tissue level hippocampal simulation, featuring multicompartmental neuron models with multiple ion channel subtypes and synaptic channels with realistic temporal dynamics. As an index of the schizophrenic phenotype, we used the specific inability of the model to attune to 40 Hz (gamma band) stimulation, a well-characterized abnormality in schizophrenia. We examined several possible combinations of putatively schizophrenogenic cellular lesions by systematically varying model parameters representing NMDA channel function, dendritic spine density, and GABA system integrity, conducting 910 trials in total. Two discrete "clusters" of neuropathological changes were identified. The most robust was characterized by co-occurring modest reductions in NMDA system function (-30\%) and dendritic spine density (-30\%). Another set of lesions had greater NMDA hypofunction along with low level GABA system dysregulation. To the schizophrenic model, we applied the effects of 1,500 virtual medications, which were implemented by varying five model parameters, independently, in a graded manner; the effects of known drugs were also applied. The simulation accurately distinguished agents that are known to lack clinical efficacy, and identified novel mechanisms (e.g., decrease in AMPA conductance decay time constant, increase in projection strength of calretinin-positive interneurons) and combinations of mechanisms that could re-equilibrate model behavior. These findings shed light on the mechanistic links between schizophrenic neuropathology and the gamma band oscillatory abnormalities observed in the illness. As such, they generate specific falsifiable hypotheses, which can guide postmortem and other laboratory research. Significantly, this work also suggests specific non-obvious targets for potential pharmacologic agents.},

  abstract    = {Since the original formulation of the dopamine hypothesis, a number of other cellular-level abnormalities--eg, NMDA receptor hypofunction, GABA system dysfunction, neural connectivity disturbances--have been identified in schizophrenia, but the manner in which these potentially interact with hyperdopaminergia to lead to schizophrenic symptomatology remains uncertain. Previously, we created a neuroanatomically detailed, biophysically realistic computational model of hippocampus in the control (unaffected) and schizophrenic conditions, implemented on a 72-processor supercomputer platform. In the current study, we apply the effects of dopamine (DA), dose-dependently, to both models on the basis of an exhaustive review of the neurophysiologic literature on DA's ion channel and synaptic level effects. To index schizophrenic behavior, we use the specific inability of the model to attune to the 40 Hz (gamma band) frequency, a finding that has been well replicated in the clinical electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography literature. In trials using 20 'simulated patients', we find that DA applied to the control model produces modest increases in 40 Hz activity, similar to experimental studies. However, in the schizophrenic model, increasing DA induces a decrement in 40 Hz resonance. This modeling work is significant in that it suggests that DA's effects may vary based on the neural substrate on which it acts, and--via simulated EEG recordings-points to the neurophysiologic mechanisms by which this may occur. We also feel that it makes a methodological contribution, as it exhibits a process by which a large amount of neurobiological data can be integrated to run pharmacologically relevant in silico experiments, using a systems biology approach.},

This is suggested by the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists, the ameliorative effects of NMDAR indirect agonists, elevated levels of the NMDA antagonist N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) in schizophrenic brain, and findings from recent genetic studies. However, the link between reduced NMDAR function and the behavioral features of schizophrenics has not been made explicit. Here we present a network simulation of hippocampal function, focused on retrieval of verbal stimuli in human memory tasks. Specifically, we trained a computational model of the hippocampal complex to perform a context-dependent paired associate task, a free recall task with category clustering, and the transitive inference (TI) task. In this network, direct perforant pathway input from entorhinal cortex to region CA1 provides the basis for semantic context cueing during initial encoding and retrieval, allowing selective retrieval on the basis of category cues. Alterations in the magnitude of this direct perforant pathway input to region CA1 causes impairments in use of organizational strategies for memory, accounting for specific features of memory dysfunction in schizophrenics and in normals treated with ketamine. This model provides a theoretical link between cellular physiological changes and specific cognitive symptoms. As such, it can shed light on the etiology of schizophrenia in a fundamental way, and also holds the promise of pointing the way to more effective treatments.},

  abstract  = {Abnormalities in functional connectivity between brain areas have been postulated as an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying schizophrenia. In particular, macroscopic measurements of brain activity in patients suggest that functional connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes may be altered. However, it remains unclear whether such dysconnectivity relates to the aetiology of the illness, and how it is manifested in the activity of neural circuits. Because schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, animal models of genetic risk factors are likely to aid our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease. Here we study {Df(16)A(+/-)} mice, which model a microdeletion on human chromosome 22 (22q11.2) that constitutes one of the largest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. To examine functional connectivity in these mice, we measured the synchronization of neural activity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during the performance of a task requiring working memory, which is one of the cognitive functions disrupted in the disease. In wild-type mice, hippocampal-prefrontal synchrony increased during working memory performance, consistent with previous reports in rats. {Df(16)A(+/-)} mice, which are impaired in the acquisition of the task, showed drastically reduced synchrony, measured both by phase-locking of prefrontal cells to hippocampal theta oscillations and by coherence of prefrontal and hippocampal local field potentials. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal-prefrontal coherence at the onset of training could be used to predict the time it took the {Df(16)A(+/-)} mice to learn the task and increased more slowly during task acquisition. These data suggest how the deficits in functional connectivity observed in patients with schizophrenia may be realized at the single-neuron level. Our findings further suggest that impaired long-range synchrony of neural activity is one consequence of the 22q11.2 deletion and may be a fundamental component of the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {The complete axon arborization of a single CA3 pyramidal cell has been reconstructed from 32 (60 microns thick) sections from the rat hippocampus following in vivo intracellular injection of neurobiotin. The same sections were double-immunostained for parvalbumin--a calcium-binding protein selectively present in two types of GABAergic interneurons, the basket and chandelier cells--in order to map boutons of the pyramidal cell in contact with dendrites and somata of these specific subsets of interneurons visualized in a Golgi-like manner. The axon of the pyramidal cell formed 15,295 boutons, 63.8\% of which were in stratum oriens, 15.4\% in stratum pyramidale and 20.8\% in stratum radiatum. Only 2.1\% of the axon terminals contacted parvalbumin-positive neurons. Most of these were single contacts (84.7\%), but double or triple contacts (15.3\%) were also found. The majority of the boutons terminated on dendrites (84.1\%) of parvalbumin-positive cells, less frequently on cell bodies (15.9\%). In order to estimate the proportion of contacts representing synapses, 16 light microscopically identified contacts between boutons of the filled pyramidal cell axon and the parvalbumin-positive targets were examined by correlated electron microscopy. Thirteen of them were found to be asymmetrical synapses, and in the remaining three cases synapses between the labelled profiles could not be confirmed. We conclude that the physiologically effective excitatory connections between single pyramidal cells and postsynaptic inhibitory neurons are mediated by a small number of contacts, mostly by a single synapse. This results in a high degree of convergence and divergence in hippocampal networks.},

It is also unclear as to whether amphetamines exert effects on stimulus evaluation or response selection. In two studies, independent groups of twenty healthy illicit stimulant users aged between 21 and 32 years were administered 0.42 mg/kg d-amphetamine versus placebo, and 0.42 mg/kg d-methamphetamine versus placebo respectively, and completed an auditory oddball task on two separate testing days. A 62-channel EEG was recorded during the completion of the task, and the effects of amphetamines on N200 and P300 ERP components were analysed. d-amphetamine significantly decreased reaction time, improved accuracy, and reduced the latency of the P300 component relative to placebo, while having no effect on the N200 component. d-methamphetamine had no effect on reaction time, accuracy or the P300 component, but reduced the amplitude of the N200 component, relative to placebo. It was concluded that there is tentative support to suggest that d-amphetamine at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg may enhance speed of information processing while d-methamphetamine at a dose of 0.42 mg/kg may reflect changes to stimulus evaluation.},

Search for the neuronal substrate of awareness therefore converges with the search for the cognitive mechanisms through which brains analyze their environment. The hypothesis is put forward that the mammalian brain generates continuously highly dynamic states that, when modulated by input signals, rapidly converge towards points of transient stability that correspond to the respective input constellation. It is proposed that these states are characterized by the dynamic binding of feature-specific cells into functionally coherent cell assemblies which as a whole represent the constellation of features defining a particular perceptual object. Arguments are presented that favor the notion that the cognitive operations supporting awareness consist of an iteration of such dynamic binding processes which then lead to the formation of higher-order assemblies that correspond to the contents of conscious awareness. Experimental data are reviewed relating to the questions of how assemblies are formed and which signatures define the relations among the responses of distributed neurons. It is argued that assemblies self-organize through reciprocal interactions of neurons coupled by reentrant loops and that the signature of relatedness consists of the transient synchronization of the discharges of the respective neurons. Evidence is presented that these synchronization phenomena depend on the same state variables as awareness: Both require for their manifestation activated brain states characterized by desynchronized EEGs. It is concluded that phenomenal awareness is amenable to neurobiological reductionism; but it is also proposed that self-consciousness requires a different explanatory approach because it emerges from the dialogue between different brains and hence has the quality of a cultural construct.},

  abstract    = {The relationship between presynaptic calcium transients ([Ca2+]t) and transmitter release evoked by a single stimulus was both investigated experimentally and modeled at a mammalian central synapse, the CA3 to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse in guinea pig hippocampal slices. In the present study, we compared the low-affinity calcium indicator furaptra with the higher-affinity indicator fura-2. The 10-90\% rise time of the furaptra transient was 2.4 ms compared to 7.8 ms with fura-2; the half-decay time (tau 1/2) was 30 ms for furaptra, compared to 238 ms for fura-2. The half-width of the calcium influx was 1.8 ms with furaptra, which provides an upper limit to the duration of the calcium current (ICa) evoked by an action potential. Modeling the decay time course of the furaptra transients led to the conclusion that the predominant endogenous calcium buffer in these terminals must have relatively slow kinetics (kon < 10(5)/M.s), although the presence of small amounts of fast buffers cannot be excluded. The relationship between the [Ca2+]t measured with furaptra and the postsynaptic response was the same as previously observed with fura-2: the postsynaptic response was proportional to about the fourth power (m approximately 4) of the amplitude of either [Ca2+]t or calcium influx. Thus, although fura-2 may be locally saturated by the high local [Ca2+] responsible for transmitter release, the volume-averaged fura-2 signal accurately reflects changes in this local concentration. The result that both indicators gave similar values for the power m constrains the amplitude of calcium influx in our model: Ica < 1 pA for 1 ms.},

However, at present it is unclear how these pathological processes are reflected in the protein content of the synapse. We have employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in conjunction with mass spectrometry to characterize and compare the synaptic proteomes of the human left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in chronic schizophrenia and of the cerebral cortex of rats treated subchronically with ketamine. We found consistent changes in the synaptic proteomes of human schizophrenics and in rats with induced ketamine psychosis compared to controls. However, commonly regulated proteins between both groups were very limited and only prohibitin was found upregulated in both chronic schizophrenia and the rat ketamine model. Prohibitin, however, could be a new potential marker for the synaptic pathology of schizophrenia and might be causally involved in the disease process.},

This deficit is most commonly modeled in rodents by implanted electrode recordings from the hippocampus of the rodent analog of the P50, the P20-N40. The validity and effectiveness of this tool, however, has not been systematically reviewed. Here, we summarize findings from studies that have examined the effects of pharmacologic modulation on gating of the rodent hippocampal P20-N40 and the human P50. We show that drug effects on the P20-N40 are highly predictive of human effects across similar dose ranges. Furthermore, mental status (for example, anesthetized vs alert) does not appear to diminish the predictive capacity of these recordings. We then discuss hypothesized neuropharmacologic mechanisms that may underlie gating effects for each drug studied. Overall, this review supports continued use of hippocampal P20-N40 gating as a translational tool for schizophrenia research.},

Studies investigating the neurobiology of underlying MJ effects have demonstrated structural and functional alterations in brain areas that contain moderate to high concentrations of cannabinoid (CB1) receptors and that are implicated in MJ-related cognitive decrements. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS), a non-invasive imaging technique used to assess neurochemistry, has been widely applied to probe a variety of substance-abusing populations. To date, however, there is a relative paucity of MRS published studies characterizing changes in neurometabolite concentrations in MJ users. Thus, the current review provides a summary of data from the eight existing MRS studies of MJ use in adolescents and adults, as well as interpretations and implications of study findings. Future MRS studies that address additional factors such as sex differences, onset and duration of use, abstinence and age, are warranted, and would lead to a more thorough characterization of potential neurochemical correlates of chronic MJ use, which would fill critical gaps in the existing literature.},

However, neuropsychological studies in humans have emphasized the importance of parietal cortex for spatial navigation, and efforts to identify the electrophysiological signs of spatial navigation in humans have been stymied by the difficulty of recording during free exploration of complex environments. We resolved the recording problem and experimentally probed brain activity of human participants who were fully ambulant. On each of 2 d, electroencephalography was synchronized with head and body movement in 13 subjects freely navigating an extended virtual environment containing numerous unique objects. θ phase and amplitude recorded over parietal cortex were consistent when subjects walked through a particular spatial separation at widely separated times. This spatial displacement θ autocorrelation (STAcc) was quantified and found to be significant from 2 to 8 Hz within the environment. Similar autocorrelation analyses performed on an electrooculographic channel, used to measure eye movements, showed no significant spatial autocorrelations, ruling out eye movements as the source of STAcc. Strikingly, the strength of an individual's STAcc maps from day 1 significantly predicted object location recall success on day 2. θ was also significantly correlated with walking speed; however, this correlation appeared unrelated to STAcc and did not predict memory performance. This is the first demonstration of memory-related, spatial maps in humans generated during active spatial exploration.},

As retrograde signalling molecules, endocannabinoids are synthesized postsynaptically but activate presynaptic cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors to inhibit neurotransmitter release. In turn, CB1-expressing inhibitory and excitatory synapses act as strategically placed control points for activity-dependent regulation of dynamically changing normal and pathological oscillatory network activity. Here, we highlight emerging principles of cannabinoid circuit control and plasticity, and discuss their relevance for epilepsy and related comorbidities. New insights into cannabinoid signalling may facilitate the translation of the recent interest in cannabis-related substances as antiseizure medications to evidence-based treatment strategies.},

  abstract    = {The cerebral cortex encodes, stores and combines information about the internal and external environment in rhythmic activity of multiple frequency ranges. Neurones of the cortex can be defined, recognized and compared on the comprehensive application of the following measures: (i) brain area- and cell domain-specific distribution of input and output synapses, (ii) expression of molecules involved in cell signalling, (iii) membrane and synaptic properties reflecting the expression of membrane proteins, (iv) temporal structure of firing in vivo, resulting from (i)-(iii). Spatial and temporal measures of neurones in the network reflect an indivisible unity of evolutionary design, i.e. neurones do not have separate structure or function. The blueprint of this design is most easily accessible in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, where a relatively uniform population of pyramidal cells and their inputs follow an instantly recognizable laminated pattern and act within stereotyped network activity patterns. Reviewing the cell types and their spatio-temporal interactions, we suggest that CA1 pyramidal cells are supported by at least 16 distinct types of GABAergic neurone. During a given behaviour-contingent network oscillation, interneurones of a given type exhibit similar firing patterns. During different network oscillations representing two distinct brain states, interneurones of the same class show different firing patterns modulating their postsynaptic target-domain in a brain-state-dependent manner. These results suggest roles for specific interneurone types in structuring the activity of pyramidal cells via their respective target domains, and accurately timing and synchronizing pyramidal cell discharge, rather than providing generalized inhibition. Finally, interneurones belonging to different classes may fire preferentially at distinct time points during a given oscillation. As different interneurones innervate distinct domains of the pyramidal cells, the different compartments will receive GABAergic input differentiated in time. Such a dynamic, spatio-temporal, GABAergic control, which evolves distinct patterns during different brain states, is ideally suited to regulating the input integration of individual pyramidal cells contributing to the formation of cell assemblies and representations in the hippocampus and, probably, throughout the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract    = {Cyclothiazide is a well-known AMPAR potentiator, but it has also been shown to enhance the probability of presynaptic release in some cases. Interestingly, cyclothiazide has been shown to reveal AMPA EPSCs at silent CA3-CA1 synapses (which exhibit NMDA EPSCs but not AMPA EPSCs) in the hippocampus of neonatal or developing rats, but this particular result has not been reproduced at other types of synapses. Although this discrepancy may be due to the different mechanisms underlying silent synapses in distinct brain subregions, it is also possible that cyclothiazide has pre- and postsynaptic molecular targets that are differentially expressed at the different types (or different developing stages) of synapses. In this study, we reexamined, using a new AMPAR potentiator, LY404187, whether AMPAR potentiation leads to the conversion of silent CA3-CA1 synapses into functional synapses (exhibiting both AMPA and NMDA EPSCs) in the hippocampus of neonatal rats. LY404187 did not appear to alter the probability of presynaptic release, as evidenced by the lack of significant changes in both the amplitude and the paired-pulse facilitation ratio (an index of release probability) of NMDA EPSCs. LY404187 enhanced both the amplitude and 1/CV(2) (CV: coefficient of variation) of AMPA EPSCs but not NMDA EPSCs. Because an increase in 1/CV(2) reflects an increased number of functional synapses and/or an enhanced release probability, the LY404187-induced increase in the 1/CV(2) value of AMPA EPSCs, but not NMDA EPSCs, likely indicates an increased number of synapses exhibiting AMPA EPSCs but not an increased number of synapses exhibiting NMDA EPSCs. Because AMPARs and NMDARs are co-localized at the same synapses, our findings are consistent with a scenario in which LY404187 enables silent synapses to acquire AMPA EPSCs.},

The key to evaluating candidate explanatory models, therefore, is to establish causal links between disease-related phenomena observed across these scales. To this end, there has been a resurgence of interest in the circuit-level pathophysiology of schizophrenia, which has the potential to link molecular and cellular data from risk factor and post-mortem studies with the behavioral phenomena that plague patients. The demonstration that patients with schizophrenia frequently have deficits in neuronal synchrony, including deficits in local oscillations and long-range functional connectivity, offers a promising opportunity to forge such links across scales.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia is characterized by cortical circuit abnormalities, which might be reflected in gamma-frequency (30-100 Hz) oscillations in the electroencephalogram. Here we used a computational model of cortical circuitry to examine the effects that neural circuit abnormalities might have on gamma generation and network excitability. The model network consisted of 1000 leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic connectivity patterns and proportions of neuron types [pyramidal cells (PCs), regular-spiking inhibitory interneurons, and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs)]. The network produced a gamma oscillation when driven by noise input. We simulated reductions in: (1) recurrent excitatory inputs to PCs; (2) both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to PCs; (3) all possible connections between cells; (4) reduced inhibitory output from FSIs; and (5) reduced NMDA input to FSIs. Reducing all types of synaptic connectivity sharply reduced gamma power and phase synchrony. Network excitability was reduced when recurrent excitatory connections were deleted, but the network showed disinhibition effects when inhibitory connections were deleted. Reducing FSI output impaired gamma generation to a lesser degree than reducing synaptic connectivity, and increased network excitability. Reducing FSI NMDA input also increased network excitability, but increased gamma power. The results of this study suggest that a multimodal approach, combining non-invasive neurophysiological and structural measures, might be able to distinguish between different neural circuit abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Computational modeling may help to bridge the gaps between post-mortem studies, animal models, and experimental data in humans, and facilitate the development of new therapies for schizophrenia and neuropsychiatric disorders in general.},

  abstract    = {Several studies have reported deficits in γ oscillatory activity elicited by sensory stimulation or cognitive processes in schizophrenia patients (SZ) compared to healthy control subjects (HC). However, the evidence for cortical hyperexcitability and reduced function of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) on parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in schizophrenia leads to the prediction that γ activity should rather be increased in SZ, but data supporting this hypothesis have been lacking. One possibility is that baseline induced γ power is increased, an effect that might have gone unnoticed in studies of stimulus-locked oscillations. Here we addressed this question by re-analyzing the data from a previously published study on the 40 Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) in schizophrenia in which dipole source localization was used to examine γ responses in the left and right auditory cortices. Subjects were 16 HC and 18 chronic SZ, who listened to trains of clicks presented at 40 Hz during electroencephalogram recording. Independent component analysis was used to remove ocular artifacts. Power spectra were computed for the pre-stimulus baseline period. We found that baseline power was higher in SZ than HC at 40 Hz in the left auditory cortex. Baseline 40 Hz power in the left auditory cortex was also correlated with ASSR evoked power in SZ. Thus, γ oscillation abnormalities in schizophrenia may include abnormal increases in baseline power as well as deficits in evoked oscillations. These baseline increases could be the sign of NMDAR hypofunction on parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons, which would be consistent with acute NMDAR antagonism and genetic ablation models of schizophrenia.},

This study further characterized the behavior and physiology of the delta mutants.Seizure susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) injection, intracellular recordings, and whole-cell patch recordings in dentate granule neurons was determined.Susceptibility to PTZ-induced convulsive seizures was significantly higher in -/- versus +/+ mice. In intracellular recordings, the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) had much faster decay tau in -/- mutants (25 +/- 3.5 ms) compared with +/+ controls (51 +/- 5.2 ms). In whole-cell patch recordings, the decay tau of pharmacologically isolated miniature spontaneous GABA(A)R-mediated synaptic currents (mIPSCs) from -/- mice was only slightly, but significantly faster (5.7 +/- 0.13 ms; n = 18) than that of +/+ controls (6.8 +/- 0.32 ms; n = 20). Furthermore, mIPSC prolongation by bath application of alphaxalone (10 microM), was much smaller in -/- mice (52 +/- 12\%; n = 3) compared with +/+ littermates (192 +/- 14\%; n = 3).Faster decay of evoked IPSPs and mIPSCs is consistent with altered GABA(A)R subunit composition in the delta mutants, but suggests predominant extrasynaptic delta subunit location in the dentate gyrus of normal mice. Faster-decaying IPSPs likely contribute to the proepileptic phenotype of the delta mutants. Reduced neurosteroid sensitivity might also contribute to seizure susceptibility. It remains to be determined whether delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs represent the actual target of neurosteroids or whether the behavioral and physiologic sensitivity to neurosteroids is indirectly altered in the delta-/- mice.},

  abstract    = {Numerous studies demonstrated a close relationship between cannabis abuse and schizophrenia with similar impairments in cognitive processing, particularly in P300 generation. Recently, an (AAT)n triplet repeat polymorphism within the cannabinoid receptor gene CNR1 has been found to be associated with both schizophrenia and substance dependence, and to modulate the P300 potential. As previously reported, both acute oral Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and standardized cannabis extract containing Δ(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) revealed a significant reduction of P300 amplitudes in healthy subjects but did not show any differences among each other. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the (AAT)n polymorphism differentially modulates the effects of Δ(9)-THC and cannabis extract on P300 generation in 20 healthy volunteers during an auditory choice reaction task. For the >10/>10 genotype, there was a significant decrease of P300 amplitude as well as a significant prolongation of P300 latency under pure Δ(9)-THC but not under cannabis extract. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the number of AAT repeats and P300 variables for the Δ(9)-THC condition. Our data thus indicate that the CNR1 gene seems to be involved in the regulation of the P300 wave as a marker of selective attention and working memory. Moreover, it appears that variations within CNR1 may differentially alter the sensitivity to the acute effects of cannabinoids on P300 generation in healthy subjects.},

  abstract  = {Tight coupling between gamma-aminobutyric acid {(GABA)} synthesis and vesicle filling suggests that the presynaptic supply of precursor glutamate could dynamically regulate inhibitory synapses. Although the neuronal glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 3 {(EAAT3)} has been proposed to mediate such a metabolic role, highly efficient astrocytic uptake of synaptically released glutamate normally maintains low-extracellular glutamate levels. We examined whether axodendritic inhibitory synapses in stratum radiatum of hippocampal area {CA1}, which are closely positioned among excitatory glutamatergic synapses, are regulated by synaptic glutamate release via presynaptic uptake. Under conditions of spatially and temporally coordinated release of glutamate and {GABA} within pyramidal cell dendrites, blocking glial glutamate uptake enhanced quantal release of {GABA} in a transporter-dependent manner. These physiological findings correlated with immunohistochemical studies revealing expression of {EAAT3} by interneurons and uptake of D-asparate into putative axodendritic inhibitory terminals only when glial uptake was blocked. These results indicate that spillover of glutamate between adjacent excitatory and inhibitory synapses can occur under conditions when glial uptake incompletely clears synaptically released glutamate. Our anatomical studies also suggest that perisomatic inhibitory synapses, unlike synapses within dendritic layers of hippocampus, are not capable of glutamate uptake and therefore transporter-mediated dynamic regulation of inhibition is a unique feature of axodendritic synapses that may play a role in maintaining a homeostatic balance of inhibition and excitation.},

Approximately one third of patients are resistant to currently available medication. New therapeutic targets and a better understanding of the basic biological processes that drive pathogenesis are needed in order to develop therapies that will improve quality of life for these patients. Several drugs that act on neurotransmitter systems in the brain have been suggested to model aspects of schizophrenia in animals and in man. In this paper, we selectively review findings from dopaminergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, cannabinoid, GABA, cholinergic and kappa opioid pharmacological drug models to evaluate their similarity to schizophrenia. Understanding the interactions between these different neurotransmitter systems and their relationship with symptoms will be an important step towards building a coherent hypothesis for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) is expressed in different neuronal populations in the mammalian brain. In particular, CB1 on GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons exerts different functions and display different pharmacological properties in vivo. This suggests the existence of neuron-type specific signalling pathways activated by different subpopulations of CB1. In this study, we analysed CB1 expression, binding and signalling in the hippocampus of conditional mutant mice, bearing CB1 deletion in GABAergic (GABA-CB1-KO mice) or cortical glutamatergic neurons (Glu-CB1-KO mice). Compared to their wild-type littermates, Glu-CB1-KO displayed a small decrease of CB1 mRNA amount, immunoreactivity and [³H]CP55,940 binding. Conversely, GABA-CB1-KO mice showed a drastic reduction of these parameters, confirming that CB1 is present at much higher density on hippocampal GABAergic interneurons than glutamatergic neurons. Surprisingly, however, saturation analysis of HU210-stimulated [(35) S]GTPγS binding demonstrated that 'glutamatergic' CB1 is more efficiently coupled to G protein signalling than 'GABAergic' CB1. Thus, the minority of CB1 on glutamatergic neurons is paradoxically several fold more strongly coupled to G protein signalling than 'GABAergic' CB1. This selective signalling mechanism raises the possibility of designing novel cannabinoid ligands that differentially activate only a subset of physiological effects of CB1 stimulation, thereby optimizing therapeutic action.},

  abstract    = {Over the last 2 decades, a large number of neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have furnished in vivo evidence for dysconnectivity, ie, abnormal functional integration of brain processes. While the evidence for dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is strong, its etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and significance for clinical symptoms are unclear. First, dysconnectivity could result from aberrant wiring of connections during development, from aberrant synaptic plasticity, or from both. Second, it is not clear how schizophrenic symptoms can be understood mechanistically as a consequence of dysconnectivity. Third, if dysconnectivity is the primary pathophysiology, and not just an epiphenomenon, then it should provide a mechanistic explanation for known empirical facts about schizophrenia. This article addresses these 3 issues in the framework of the dysconnection hypothesis. This theory postulates that the core pathology in schizophrenia resides in aberrant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic plasticity due to abnormal regulation of NMDARs by neuromodulatory transmitters like dopamine, serotonin, or acetylcholine. We argue that this neurobiological mechanism can explain failures of self-monitoring, leading to a mechanistic explanation for first-rank symptoms as pathognomonic features of schizophrenia, and may provide a basis for future diagnostic classifications with physiologically defined patient subgroups. Finally, we test the explanatory power of our theory against a list of empirical facts about schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis use in early adolescence may be a risk factor for development of schizophrenia. In animals, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) increases the rate of dopamine neuronal firing and release in the striatum. Thus cannabis use may increase dopamine release in the human striatum leading to vulnerability to psychosis.To investigate whether THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, can produce dopamine release in the human striatum.Thirteen healthy volunteers, with previous cannabis experience, underwent two [11C]-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) scans to indirectly measure striatal dopamine levels following either 10 mg THC or placebo.Although THC markedly increased psychosis-like symptoms on the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI), there was no significant effect of THC on [11C]-raclopride binding.In the largest study of its kind so far, we have shown that recreational cannabis users do not release significant amounts of dopamine from an oral THC dose equivalent to a standard cannabis cigarette. This result challenges current models of striatal dopamine release as the mechanism mediating cannabis as risk factor for schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Depolarization-induced suppression of excitation and inhibition (DSE and DSI) appear to be important forms of short-term retrograde neuronal plasticity involving endocannabinoids (eCB) and the activation of presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors. We report here that CB1-dependent DSE can be elicited from autaptic cultures of excitatory mouse hippocampal neurones. DSE in autaptic cultures is both more robust and elicited with a more physiologically relevant stimulus than has been thus far reported for conventional hippocampal cultures. An additional requirement for autaptic DSE is filled internal calcium stores. Pharmacological experiments favour a role for 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) rather than arachidonyl ethanolamide (AEA) or noladin ether as the relevant endocannabinoid to elicit DSE. In particular, the latter two compounds fail to reversibly inhibit EPSCs, a quality inconsistent with the role of bona fide eCB mediating DSE. Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) fails to inhibit EPSCs, yet readily occludes both DSE and EPSC inhibition by a synthetic CB1 agonist, WIN 55212-2. With long-term exposure (approximately 18 h), delta9-THC also desensitizes CB1 receptors. Lastly, a functional endocannabinoid transporter is necessary for the expression of DSE.},

Recent functional imaging data implicate the hippocampus in processing novelty, a finding supported by human in vivo recordings and event-related potential studies. Here we measure hippocampal responses to novelty, using functional MRI (fMRI), during an item-learning paradigm generated from an artificial grammar system. During learning, two distinct types of novelty were periodically introduced: perceptual novelty, pertaining to the physical characteristics of stimuli (in this case visual characteristics), and exemplar novelty, reflecting semantic characteristics of stimuli (in this case grammatical status within a rule system). We demonstrate a left anterior hippocampal response to both types of novelty and adaptation of these responses with stimulus familiarity. By contrast to these novelty effects, we also show bilateral posterior hippocampal responses with increasing exemplar familiarity. These results suggest a functional dissociation within the hippocampus with respect to the relative familiarity of study items. Neural responses in anterior hippocampus index generic novelty, whereas posterior hippocampal responses index familiarity to stimuli that have behavioral relevance (i.e., only exemplar familiarity). These findings add to recent evidence for functional segregation within the human hippocampus during learning.},

The dominant view is that the dorsal (or posterior) hippocampus is implicated in memory and spatial navigation and the ventral (or anterior) hippocampus mediates anxiety-related behaviours. However, this 'dichotomy view' may need revision. Gene expression studies demonstrate multiple functional domains along the hippocampal long axis, which often exhibit sharply demarcated borders. By contrast, anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings in rodents suggest that the long axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these observations suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are superimposed on discrete functional domains. This model provides a potential framework to explain and test the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus.},

We have therefore developed an interactive diagram with the aim to display all of the currently known anatomical connections of the rat parahippocampal–hippocampal network. In this Review, we integrate the existing anatomical knowledge into a concise description of this network and discuss the functional implications of some relatively underexposed connections.},

  abstract    = {Animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders are current topics in behavioral neuroscience. Application of non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors (such as MK-801) was proposed as a model of schizophrenia, as it leads to specific behavioral alterations, which are partly analogous to human psychotic symptoms. This study examined an animal model of schizophrenia induced by a systemic application of MK-801 (0.15 and 0.20 mg/kg) into rats tested in the active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task. Previous studies suggested that MK-801 may interact in vivo with other neurotransmitter systems, including noradrenergic system. Our experiments therefore evaluated the hypothesis that both locomotor stimulation and deficit in avoidance behavior in AAPA task induced by this drug would be reversible by application of alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (1 and 2 mg/kg). The results showed that both doses of prazosin partially reversed hyperlocomotion induced by higher doses of MK-801 and an avoidance deficit measured as number of entrances into the shock sector. Interestingly, no effect of prazosin on the MK-801-induced decrease of maximum time between two entrances (another measure of cognitive performance) was observed. These results support previous data showing that prazosin can compensate for the hyperlocomotion induced by MK-801 and newly show that this partial reduction sustains even in the forced locomotor conditions, which are involved in the AAPA task. The study also shows that certain parameters of avoidance efficiency may be closely related to locomotor activity, whereas other measures of cognition may more selectively reflect cognitive changes.},

Patients tend to show worse cognitive performance in functions subserved by those regions as compared to healthy controls in spite of higher regional activation. However, the association between activation abnormalities and cognitive deficits remains without being understood. In the present study, we compared cerebral perfusion using single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) in patients and controls to study the association between activation patterns and cognitive performance in this disease. The SPECT studies were simultaneously obtained with an electrophysiological recording during a P300 paradigm to elicit P3a and P3b components. We included 23 stable patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 29 healthy controls that underwent clinical and cognitive assessments. Patients with schizophrenia showed an increased perfusion in the right hippocampus with respect to healthy controls, they also displayed a statistically significant inverse association between perfusion in the left hippocampus and verbal memory performance. Healthy controls showed an inverse association between perfusion in the left dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) region and working memory performance. P3b but not P3a amplitude was significantly lower in patients. The limbic overactivation in the patients may contribute to their cognitive deficits in verbal memory.},

These included the tetrad of tests in mice commonly used to assess cannabinoid-induced effects (motor activity, ring catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia tests), as well as a model for agonistic behavior on dyadic interactions of singly housed males with nonaggressive group-housed partners. Anandamide-induced effects on leukocyte phagocytosis were measured in a chemiluminescence assay. Results indicated that the higher doses tested (10-100 mg/kg) produced the well-known inhibitory effects in all of the above parameters as well as inhibition of phagocytosis. The lowest dose of anandamide tested (0.01 mg/kg) stimulated behavioral activities in the open field, on the ring and aggressive behavior in timid singly housed mice. This dose of 0.01 mg/kg, also stimulated phagocytosis. We suggest several possible mechanisms to explain these findings such as a differential involvement of a Gs and a Gi protein activated at low and high doses, respectively, allosteric modulation of the cannabinoid, and activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptors by low doses of anandamide.},

Progress is being made in the development of novel agonists and antagonists with receptor subtype selectivity which should help in providing a greater understanding of the physiological role of the endocannabinoid system and perhaps also in a broad number of pathologies. This could lead to advances with important therapeutic potential of drugs modulating activity of endocannabinoid system as hypnotics, analgesics, antiemetics, antiasthmatics, antihypertensives, immunomodulatory drugs, antiphlogistics, neuroprotective agents, antiepileptics, agents influencing glaucoma, spasticity and other "movement disorders", eating disorders, alcohol withdrawal, hepatic fibrosis, bone growth, and atherosclerosis.

  abstract    = {A subpopulation of GABAergic cells in cortical structures expresses CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1 ) on their axon terminals. To understand the function of these interneurons in information processing, it is necessary to uncover how they are embedded into neuronal circuits. Therefore, the proportion of GABAergic terminals expressing CB1 and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of CB1 -immunoreactive interneurons should be revealed. We investigated the ratio and the origin of CB1 -expressing inhibitory boutons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Using immunocytochemical techniques, we estimated that ∼40\% of GABAergic axon terminals in different layers of CA3 also expressed CB1 . To identify the inhibitory cell types expressing CB1 in this region, we recorded and intracellularly labeled interneurons in hippocampal slices. CB1 -expressing interneurons showed distinct axonal arborization, and were classified as basket cells, mossy-fiber-associated cells, dendritic-layer-innervating cells or perforant-path-associated cells. In each morphological category, a substantial variability in axonal projection was observed. In contrast to the diverse morphology, the active and passive membrane properties were found to be rather similar. Using paired recordings, we found that pyramidal cells displayed large and fast unitary postsynaptic currents in response to activating basket and mossy-fiber-associated cells, while they showed slower and smaller synaptic events in pairs originating from interneurons that innervate the dendritic layer, which may be due to dendritic filtering. In addition, CB1 activation significantly reduced the amplitude of the postsynaptic currents in each cell pair tested. Our data suggest that CB1 -expressing interneurons with different axonal projections have comparable physiological characteristics, contributing to a similar proportion of GABAergic inputs along the somato-dendritic axis of CA3 pyramidal cells.},

  abstract    = {Glutamatergic synapses on some hippocampal GABAergic interneurons exhibit activity-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). Interneuron types within the CA1 area expressing mutually exclusive molecular markers differ in LTP responses. Potentiation that depends on calcium-permeable (CP) AMPA receptors has been characterized in oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneurons, which express parvalbumin and somatostatin (SM). However, it is unknown how widely CP-AMPAR-dependent plasticity is expressed among different GABAergic interneuron types. Here we examine synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampal O-LM cells and two other interneuron types expressing either nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or cholecystokinin (CCK), which are known to be physiologically and developmentally distinct. We report similar CP-AMPAR-dependent LTP in NOS-immunopositive ivy cells and SM-expressing O-LM cells to afferent fiber theta burst stimulation. The potentiation in both cell types is induced at postsynaptic membrane potentials below firing threshold, and induction is blocked by intense spiking simultaneously with afferent stimulation. The strong inward rectification and calcium permeability of AMPARs is explained by a low level of GluA2 subunit mRNA expression. LTP is not elicited in CCK-expressing Schaffer collateral-associated cells, which lack CP-AMPARs and express high levels of the GluA2 subunit. The results show that CP-AMPAR-mediated synaptic potentiation is common in hippocampal interneuron types and occurs in interneurons of both feedforward and feedback inhibitory pathways.},

  abstract    = {The morphological properties and connectivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic hippocampal cells projecting to the medial septum (HS cells) were examined in the rat. Two types of HS cells are located in different layers of the hippocampus: sparsely-spiny cells are in CA1-3 str. oriens and CA3 str. radiatum, where recurrent axons of pyramidal cells arborize. Densely-spiny HS cells with spiny somata are located in the termination zone of granule cell axons. In the hilus, intermediate morphologies can also be found. HS cells receive GABAergic medial septal afferents in all layers where they occur, thus the connectivity of the septum and the hippocampus is reciprocal at cell level. HS cells receive extremely dense innervation, sparsely-spiny cells are innervated by approximately 19,000 excitatory inputs, while densely-spiny cells get an even larger number (approximately 37,000). While 14\% of the inputs are inhibitory for the sparsely-spiny cells, it is only 2.3\% in the case of densely-spiny cells. Because a high proportion (up to 54.5\% on somata and 27.5\% on dendrites) of their GABAergic inputs derived from labelled septal terminals, their predominant inhibitory input probably arises from the medial septum. CA1 area HS cells possessed myelinated projecting axons, as well as local collaterals, which targeted mostly pyramidal cell dendrites and spines in str. oriens and radiatum. The synaptic organization suggests that by sampling the activity of large populations of principal cells HS cells can reliably broadcast hippocampal activity level to the medial septum.},

  abstract    = {The two main glutamatergic pathways to the CA1 area, the Schaffer collateral/commissural input and the entorhinal fibers, as well as the local axons of CA1 pyramidal cells innervate both pyramidal cells and interneurons. To determine whether these inputs differ in their weights of activating GABAergic circuits, we have studied the relative proportion of pyramidal cells and interneurons among their postsynaptic targets in serial electron microscopic sections. Local axons of CA1 pyramidal cells, intracellularly labeled in vitro or in vivo, innervated a relatively high proportion of interneuronal postsynaptic targets (65.9 and 53.8\%, in vitro and in vivo, respectively) in stratum (str.) oriens and alveus. In contrast, axons of in vitro labeled CA3 pyramidal cells in str. oriens and str. radiatum of the CA1 area made synaptic junctions predominantly with pyramidal cell spines (92.9\%). The postsynaptic targets of anterogradely labeled medial entorhinal cortical boutons in CA1 str. lacunosum-moleculare were primarily pyramidal neuron dendritic spines and shafts (90.8\%). The alvear group of the entorhinal afferents, traversing str. oriens, str. pyramidale, and str. radiatum showed a higher preference for innervating GABAergic cells (21.3\%), particularly in str. oriens/alveus. These data demonstrate that different glutamatergic pathways innervate CA1 GABAergic cells to different extents. The results suggest that the numerically smaller CA1 local axonal inputs together with the alvear part of the entorhinal input preferentially act on GABAergic interneurons in contrast to the CA3, or the entorhinal input in str. lacunosum-moleculare. The results highlight differences in the postsynaptic target selection of the feed-forward versus recurrent glutamatergic inputs to the CA1 and CA3 areas.},

Using electron microscopic reconstructions, we estimated that a pyramidal cell body receives synapses from about 60 and 140 synaptic terminals in the CA1 and CA3 area, respectively. About 60 \% of these terminals were PV positive, whereas 35-40 \% of them were CB1 positive. Only about 1 \% (CA1) and 4 \% (CA3) of the somatic boutons were negative for both markers. Using fluorescent labeling, we showed that most of the CB1-positive terminals expressed vesicular glutamate transporter 3. Reconstruction of somatic boutons revealed that although their volumes are similar, CB1-positive boutons are more flat and the total volume of their mitochondria was smaller than that of PV-positive boutons. Both types of boutons contain dense-core vesicles and frequently formed multiple release sites on their targets and innervated an additional soma or dendrite as well. PV-positive boutons possessed small, macular synapses; whereas the total synaptic area of CB1-positive boutons was larger and formed multiple irregular-shaped synapses. Axo-axonic boutons were smaller than somatic boutons, had only one synapse and their ultrastructural parameters were closer to those of PV-positive somatic boutons. Our results represent the first quantitative measurement-using a highly reliable method-of the contribution of different cell types to the perisomatic innervation of pyramidal neurons, and may help to explain functional differences in their output properties.},

  abstract    = {The matrix-like organization of the hippocampus, with its several inputs and outputs, has given rise to several theories related to hippocampal information processing. Single-cell electrophysiological studies and studies of lesions or genetically altered animals using recognition memory tasks such as delayed non-matching-to-sample (DNMS) tasks support the theories. However, a complete understanding of hippocampal function necessitates knowledge of the encoding of information by multiple neurons in a single trial. The role of neuronal ensembles in the hippocampal CA1 for a DNMS task was assessed quantitatively in this study using multi-neuronal recordings and an artificial neural network classifier as a decoder.The activity of small neuronal ensembles (6-18 cells) over brief time intervals (2-50 ms) contains accurate information specifically related to the matching/non-matching of continuously presented stimuli (stimulus comparison). The accuracy of the combination of neurons pooled over all the ensembles was markedly lower than those of the ensembles over all examined time intervals.The results show that the spatiotemporal patterns of spiking activity among cells in the small neuronal ensemble contain much information that is specifically useful for the stimulus comparison. Small neuronal networks in the hippocampal CA1 might therefore act as a comparator during recognition memory tasks.},

This has established a library of biomarker information on individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder with psychosis.

  abstract    = {The hippocampal formation is one of the most extensively studied regions of the brain, with well-described anatomy and basic physiology; moreover, aspects of human memory mediated by the hippocampus are well characterized. In schizophrenia, alterations in hippocampal anatomy, perfusion, and activation are consistently reported; impairments in declarative memory function, especially in the flexible use of event memories (e.g., in the service of memory-based inference), are common. Postmortem molecular changes suggest a selective reduction in glutamate transmission in the dentate gyrus and in its efferent fibers, the mossy fiber pathway. A reduction in dentate gyrus glutamatergic output and in its information processing functions could generate two co-occurring outcomes in the hippocampus: 1) a change in homeostatic plasticity processes in cornu ammonis 3 (CA3), accompanied by increased activity due to reduced afferent stimulation from the dentate gyrus onto CA3 neurons, a process that could increase the pattern completion functions of CA3, and 2) the loss of mnemonic functions specific to the dentate gyrus, namely pattern separation, a change that could increase the prevalence of illusory pattern completion and reduce discrimination between present and past experiences in memory. The resulting increase in "runaway" CA3-mediated pattern completion could result in cognitive "mistakes," generating psychotic associations and resulting in memories with psychotic content. Tests of this model could result in novel approaches to the treatment of psychosis and declarative memory alterations and in novel animal preparations for basic schizophrenia research.},

  abstract    = {Neuronal activity at gamma frequency is impaired in schizophrenia (SZ) and is considered critical for cognitive performance. Such impairments are thought to be due to reduced N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated inhibition from parvalbumin interneurons, rather than a direct role of impaired NMDAR signaling on pyramidal neurons. However, recent studies suggest a direct role of pyramidal neurons in regulating gamma oscillations. In particular, a computational model has been proposed in which phasic currents from pyramidal cells could drive synchronized feedback inhibition from interneurons. As such, impairments in pyramidal neuron activity could lead to abnormal gamma oscillations. However, this computational model has not been tested experimentally and the molecular mechanisms underlying pyramidal neuron dysfunction in SZ remain unclear.In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that SZ-related phenotypes could arise from reduced NMDAR signaling in pyramidal neurons using forebrain pyramidal neuron specific NMDA receptor 1 knockout mice.The mice displayed increased baseline gamma power, as well as sociocognitive impairments. These phenotypes were associated with increased pyramidal cell excitability due to changes in inherent membrane properties. Interestingly, mutant mice showed decreased expression of GIRK2 channels, which has been linked to increased neuronal excitability.Our data demonstrate for the first time that NMDAR hypofunction in pyramidal cells is sufficient to cause electrophysiological, molecular, neuropathological, and behavioral changes related to SZ.},

  abstract    = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable, disruptive, childhood-onset condition, the aetiology and pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. There have been relatively few genome-wide linkage studies, and no chromosomal region has yet been unequivocally implicated. In contrast, evidence from pharmacological, neuroimaging and animal studies has suggested the involvement of specific neurotransmitter systems, notably dopaminergic pathways, in ADHD and these aetiological clues have inspired a fruitful application of the candidate gene association approach. Meta-analyses or pooled data analyses have supported association between ADHD and polymorphisms in DRD4, DRD5 and SLC6A3 which encode dopamine D4 and D5 receptors and the dopamine transporter, respectively. A weaker, but nevertheless replicated, body of evidence also supports associations with SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 kDa) and SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter). There is increasing research interest in gene-phenotype links, clinical phenotypic markers of heterogeneity and gene--environment interaction, which are likely to be important in the next generation of genetic studies.},

  abstract    = {One of the most often reported cognitive deficits of acute cannabis administration is an impaired recall of previously learned information.The aim of the present study was to determine whether cannabis-induced memory impairment in humans is mediated via glutamatergic or cholinergic pathways.Fifteen occasional cannabis users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-way cross-over study. On separate test days, subjects received combinations of pretreatment (placebo, vardenafil 20 mg or rivastigmine 3 mg) and treatment (placebo or 1,376 mg cannabis/kg body weight). Cognitive tests were administered immediately after inhalation of treatment was finished and included measures of memory (visual verbal learning task, prospective memory test, Sternberg memory test), perceptual-motor control (critical tracking task), attention (divided attention task) and motor impulsivity (stop signal task).The results of this study demonstrate that subjects under the influence of cannabis were impaired in all memory tasks, in critical tracking, divided attention and the stop signal task. Pretreatment with rivastigmine attenuated the effect of cannabis on delayed recall and showed a trend towards significance on immediate recall. When cannabis was given in combination with vardenafil, there were no significant interaction effects in any of the tasks.The present data therefore suggest that acetylcholine plays an important role in cannabis-induced memory impairment, whereas similar results for glutamate have not been demonstrated in this study.},

On two separate days, they smoked a joint containing 0 or 500 μg/kg body weight THC. ERPs were measured while subjects performed a divided attention task (DAT) and stop signal task (SST).In the DAT, THC significantly decreased P100 amplitude in occasional but not in heavy cannabis users. P300 amplitude in the DAT was significantly decreased by THC in both groups. The N200 peak in the SST was not affected by treatment in neither of the groups. Performance in the SST was impaired in both groups after THC treatment, whereas performance in the DAT was impaired by THC only in the occasional users group.The present study confirms that heavy cannabis users develop tolerance to some of the impairing behavioral effects of cannabis. This tolerance was also evident in the underlying ERPs, suggesting that tolerance demonstrated on performance level is not (completely) due to behavioral compensation.},

Abnormal gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) seen in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in schizophrenia have been hypothesized to result from developmental insults. This study investigated spontaneous gamma oscillations in schizophrenia patients having higher and lower number of MPAs. Forty drug naïve/free schizophrenia patients and 20 matched healthy controls were assessed for MPAs on the Extended Waldrop Scale (EWS). All participants underwent an awake, resting 192-channel EEG recording. Spontaneous gamma spectral power and coherence were estimated in the low- (30-50 Hz) and high-gamma (51-70 and 71-100 Hz) bands. Significantly higher power was observed in high-MPA than healthy control group in low-gamma band over right frontal, parietal and temporal regions. Spectral power in the high-gamma band (71-100 Hz) was also significantly higher in the high-MPA schizophrenia subgroup than in the healthy control group over left frontal, parietal and temporal regions. Additionally, regional intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric coherence in the low-gamma band was significantly higher in the high-MPA schizophrenia subgroup than on the healthy control group. This study is the first to provide evidence of increased spontaneous gamma power and synchrony in schizophrenia patients having higher MPAs, supporting the idea that it may represent a distinct subgroup of schizophrenia with a neurodevelopmental basis.},

  abstract    = {Phencyclidine (PCP) is a noncompetitive, open channel blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ion channel complex. When administered to immature animals, it is known to cause apoptotic neurodegeneration in several regions, and this is followed by olanzapine-sensitive, schizophrenia-like behaviors in late adolescence and adulthood. Clarification of its mechanism of action could yield data that would help to inform the treatment of schizophrenia. In our initial experiments, we found that α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) inhibited PCP-induced apoptosis in organotypic neonatal rat brain slices in a concentration-dependent and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione-sensitive manner. Calcium signaling pathways are widely implicated in apoptosis, and PCP prevents calcium influx through NMDA receptor channels. We therefore hypothesized that AMPA could protect against this effect by activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). In support of this hypothesis, pretreatment with the calcium channel blocker cadmium chloride eliminated AMPA-mediated protection against PCP. Furthermore, the L-type VDCC inhibitor nifedipine (10 µM) fully abrogated the effects of AMPA, suggesting that L-type VDCCs are required for AMPA-mediated protection against PCP-induced neurotoxicity. Whereas the P/Q-type inhibitor ω-agatoxin TK (200 nM) reduced AMPA protection by 51.7\%, the N-type VDCC inhibitor ω-conotoxin (2 µM) had no effect. Decreased AMPA-mediated protection following cotreatment with K252a, a TrkB inhibitor, suggests that brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling plays an important role. By analogy, these results suggest that activation of L-type, and to a lesser extent P/Q-type, VDCCs might be advantageous in treating conditions associated with diminished NMDAergic activity during early development.},

  abstract    = {Preclinical as well as limited clinical studies indicate that ketamine, a non-competitive glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, may exert a quick and prolonged antidepressant effect. It has been postulated that ketamine action is due to inhibition of NMDA and stimulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Here, we sought to determine whether ketamine would exert antidepressant effects in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, a putative animal model of depression and whether this effect would be associated with changes in AMPA/NMDA receptor densities in the hippocampus. Adult female WKY rats and their control Wistar rats were subjected to acute and chronic ketamine doses and their locomotor activity (LMA) and immobility in the forced swim test (FST) were evaluated. Hippocampal AMPA and NMDA receptor densities were also measured following a chronic ketamine dose. Ketamine, both acutely (0.5-5.0 mg/kg i.p.) and chronically (0.5-2.5 mg/kg daily for 10 days) resulted in a dose-dependent and prolonged decrease in immobility in FST in WKY rats only, suggesting an antidepressant-like effect in this model. Chronic treatment with an effective dose of ketamine also resulted in an increase in AMPA/NMDA receptor density ratio in the hippocampus of WKY rats. LMA was not affected by any ketamine treatment in either strain. These results indicate a rapid and lasting antidepressant-like effect of a low ketamine dose in WKY rat model of depression. Moreover, the increase in AMPA/NMDA receptor density in the hippocampus could be a contributory factor to behavioral effects of ketamine. These findings suggest potential therapeutic benefit in simultaneous reduction of central NMDA and elevation of AMPA receptor function in treatment of depression.},

  abstract    = {This article considers the possibility that defective interactions among distributed brain areas may underlie certain dysfunctions of conscious integration such as those seen in schizophrenia. Recent experimental evidence obtained using whole-head magnetoencephalography during binocular rivalry is first reviewed. The results outline a cortical network that underlies conscious integration in the normal brain. This network is not localized to a small part of the brain but it is distributed over frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital areas. Large-scale simulations of the dynamics of thalamocortical integration are then examined. These studies indicate that several factors can affect the rapid integration of the activity of distributed thalamocortical regions and the resulting behavioral performance. These simulations show that an altered dynamics of corticothalamic and corticocortical re-entrant circuits can result from increased conduction delays, blockade of voltage-dependent connections, reduced synaptic density, and disruptions of the local connectivity within a single cortical area. It can also result from alterations in the activity of diffuse ascending systems that lead to defective reinforcement of integrated activity patterns. Finally, the article briefly reviews theoretical measures of the integration of multiple brain areas, such as measures of functional clustering. These measures have been applied to PET data obtained from schizophrenic subjects and controls while performing cognitive tasks. The results show a change in the functional interactions among distributed brain areas in schizophrenics despite the absence of a change in activation patterns. The possibility is raised that disruption of re-entrant interactions among cortical areas may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

  abstract   = {{PURPOSE} The glutamate {N-methyl-D-aspartate} {(NMDA)} receptor and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and depression. Since these psychiatric disorders are common in temporal lobe epilepsy {(TLE)}, a comparison of {TLE} patients with and without coexisting psychiatric symptoms may be useful to unravel pathophysiologic mechanisms for psychosis or depression. {METHODS} We used immunoautoradiography to assess the {NR1} {NMDA} receptor subunit and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in resected {TLE} hippocampus. {RESULTS} No changes relative to comparison controls were found for {TLE} patients with schizophrenia-like psychosis or depression. Increased {NR1} was found in the dentate molecular layer in the dysphoria group and unmedicated depressed patients. {CONCLUSIONS} An increase in {NR1} protein in the dentate molecular layer suggests an upregulation of {NMDA} receptors in granule cells in {TLE} patients with dysphoria and depression. This finding is compatible with the theory that increased {NMDA} receptor function is involved in the pathogenesis of depression and that antidepressants may act by opposing this mechanism.},

  abstract    = {Gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) network oscillations have been observed in the hippocampus during several behavioral paradigms in which they are often modulated by a theta frequency (4-12 Hz) oscillation. Interneurons of the hippocampus have been shown to be crucially involved in rhythms generation, and several subtypes with distinct anatomy and physiology have been described. In particular, the oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) interneurons were shown to synapse on distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells and to spike preferentially at theta frequency, even in the presence of gamma-field oscillations. O-LM cells have also recently been shown to present higher axonal ramification in the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. By using a hippocampal network model composed of pyramidal cells and two types of interneurons (O-LM and basket cells), we show here that the O-LM interneurons lead to gamma coherence between anatomically distinct cell modules. We thus propose that this could be a mechanism for coupling longitudinally distant cells excited by entorhinal cortex inputs into gamma-coherent assemblies.},

  abstract    = {Immunohistochemical distribution of cannabinoid receptors in the adult rat brain was studied using specific purified antibodies against the amino-terminus of the CB1 receptor. Our results generally agree well with the previous studies using CB1 receptor autoradiography and messenger RNA in situ hybridization. However, because of its greater resolution, immunohistochemistry allowed identification of particular neuronal cells and fibers that possess cannabinoid receptors. CB1-like immunoreactivity was found in axons, cell bodies and dendrites, where it appeared as puncta in somata and processes. Both intensely and moderately or lightly stained neurons were observed. The intensely stained neurons were dispersed and only occur in cortical structures including hippocampal formation and olfactory bulb. Moderately or lightly stained neurons were found in caudate-putamen and amygdala. In the hippocampal formation only intensely stained neurons were observed. The cell bodies of pyramidal neurons in CA1 and CA3 fields appeared to be unstained but surrounded by a dense plexus of immunoreactive fibers. The granule cells in the dentate area were also immunonegative. Many intensely stained neurons were located at the base of the granule cell layer. CB1-like immunoreactive neurons and fibers were also found in the somatosensory, cingulate, perirhinal, entorhinal and piriform cortices, in claustrum, amygdaloid nuclei, nucleus accumbens and septum. Beaded immunoreactive fibers were detected in periaqueductal gray, nucleus tractus solitarius, spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus, dorsal horn and lamina X of the spinal cord. A triangular cap-like mass of immunoreactivity was found to surround the basal part of the Purkinje cell body in the cerebellum. Only small, lightly stained cells were found in the molecular layer in the cerebellum close to the Purkinje cell layer. The CB1 receptor is widely distributed in the forebrain and has a more restricted distribution in the hindbrain and the spinal cord. It appears to be expressed on cell bodies, dendrites and axons. According to the location and morphology, many, but not all, CB1-like immunoreactive neurons appear to be GABAergic. Therefore, cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors may play a role in modulating GABAergic neurons.},

Virtually all CB1-immunoreactive neurons (95\%) are GABAergic. CB 1 fluorescence showed a punctate pattern. In contrast, the GABA fluorescence was distributed homogeneously, suggesting that while CB 1 receptors and GABA exist in the same cells they are not localized in the same subcellular compartments. Although virtually all CB1 neurons were GABAergic, many GABAergic neurons did not contain CB1 receptors. GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal formation can be further divided into subpopulations with distinct connections and functions, using cell markers such as neuropeptides and calcium binding proteins. CB1 receptors were highly co-localized with cholecystokinin and partially co-localized with calretinin and calbindin, but not with parvalbumin. This suggests that cannabinoids may modulate GABAergic neurotransmission at the synapses on the soma and at synapses on the proximal dendrites of the principal neurons, as well as at synapses on other GABAergic interneurons.},

  abstract    = {Chronic lumbar discogenic pain (CLDP) impairs the patient's physical abilities to function within the normal physiologic loading ranges of activities of daily living. The pathogenesis of CLDP is multifactorial and not well understood. Conservative therapeutic regimens often fail to achieve sufficient pain relief. Surgical options vary greatly in surgical invasiveness as well as outcome. Definitive surgical treatment is often 360-degree fusion. The morbidity associated with this approach is significant, considering that only 65\% to 80\% of patients obtain satisfactory clinical results. This has spawned interest in minimally invasive surgical options, such as intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET; ORATEC Interventions, Inc., Menlo Park, CA), but results are conflicting.The authors describe their surgical technique of minimal access posterolateral transforaminal selective endoscopic discectomy (SED) and bipolar radiofrequency thermal annuloplasty to treat CLDP. The procedure's rationale is based on the hypothesis that annular defects are the focal points of chronic exposure between neural sensory receptors in the defect and the inflammatogenic nucleus pulposus. In contrast to other percutaneous procedures, this technique allows direct visualization and targeting of the disc nucleus and annular fissures. Our 2-year clinical result is reported.This is a retrospective review of consecutive surgical cases performed by one surgeon (ATY). The procedures were carried out from January 1997 to December 1999. Each patient has a minimum postoperative follow-up of 2 years.A total of 113 patients met the generally accepted clinical criteria for chronic lumbar discogenic pain and were selected for the procedure.Two outcome measures were used for clinical assessment: a surgeon-based modified MacNab method and a patient-based questionnaire. A mandatory poor result was given to any patient who had repeat spine surgery at the same level or has indicated dissatisfaction with the surgical result on the questionnaire response.After meeting CLDP selection criteria, provocation contrast/indigo carmine dye discography was performed. This test was used to confirm the suspected discs as pain generators. The subject surgery then followed. Only cases with one and two levels of confirmed painful discs were entered into the study. The nonoperating author (PMT) analyzed the data.Using the surgeon assessment method, 17 patients (15\%) had excellent results, 32 patients (28.3\%) had good results, 34 patients (30.1\%) had fair results and 30 patients (26.5\%) had poor results. Of the 30 patients in the poor result group, 12 reported either no improvement or worsening, and refused further surgical treatment. Of the remaining 18 patients in the poor group, 8 had spinal fusion, 3 had laminectomy and 7 had repeat spinal endoscopic surgery. The patient-based questionnaire yielded similar percentages in each category. However, only 73.5\% of the 113 patients returned the survey questionnaire. There were no aborted procedures, unexpected hemorrhage, device-related complications, neurologic deficits, perioperative deaths or late instability.Posterolateral transforaminal SED and radiofrequency thermal annuloplasty were used to interrupt the purported annular defect pain sensitization process, thought to be necessary in the genesis of chronic lumbar discogenic pain. Lack of clinical benefit from the subject procedure did not degrade any subsequent surgical or nonsurgical treatment options. The experience gained from this study warrants further investigation into the cellular and molecular processes that provided back pain relief in these patients.},

We performed extracellular recordings of identified interneurons in the hippocampal CA1 area of anesthetized rats, revealing that the firing patterns of five distinct interneuron types are differentially correlated to spontaneous gamma oscillations. The firing of bistratified cells, which target dendrites of pyramidal cells coaligned with the glutamatergic input from hippocampal area CA3, is strongly phase locked to field gamma oscillations. Parvalbumin-expressing basket, axo-axonic, and cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons exhibit moderate gamma modulation, whereas the spike timing of distal dendrite-innervating oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons is not correlated to field gamma oscillations. Cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons fire earliest in the gamma cycle, a finding that is consistent with their suggested function of thresholding individual pyramidal cells. Furthermore, we show that field gamma amplitude correlates with interneuronal spike-timing precision and firing rate. Overall, our recordings suggest that gamma synchronization in vivo is assisted by temporal- and domain-specific GABAergic inputs to pyramidal cells and is initiated in pyramidal cell dendrites in addition to somata and axon initial segments.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal CA3 area generates temporally structured network activity such as sharp waves and gamma and theta oscillations. Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells, making GABAergic synapses onto cell bodies and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells, control pyramidal cell activity and participate in network oscillations in slice preparations, but their roles in vivo remain to be tested. We have recorded the spike timing of parvalbumin-expressing basket cells in areas CA2/3 of anesthetized rats in relation to CA3 putative pyramidal cell firing and activity locally and in area CA1. During theta oscillations, CA2/3 basket cells fired on the same phase as putative pyramidal cells, but, surprisingly, significantly later than downstream CA1 basket cells. This indicates a distinct modulation of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells by basket cells, which receive different inputs. We observed unexpectedly large dendritic arborization of CA2/3 basket cells in stratum lacunosum moleculare (33\% of length, 29\% surface, and 24\% synaptic input from a total of ∼35,000), different from the dendritic arborizations of CA1 basket cells. Area CA2/3 basket cells fired phase locked to both CA2/3 and CA1 gamma oscillations, and increased firing during CA1 sharp waves, thus supporting the role of CA3 networks in the generation of gamma oscillations and sharp waves. However, during ripples associated with sharp waves, firing of CA2/3 basket cells was phase locked only to local but not CA1 ripples, suggesting the independent generation of fast oscillations by basket cells in CA1 and CA2/3. The distinct spike timing of basket cells during oscillations in CA1 and CA2/3 suggests differences in synaptic inputs paralleled by differences in dendritic arborizations.},

  abstract    = {A variety of anatomical and physiological evidence suggests that the brain performs computations using motifs that are repeated across species, brain areas, and modalities. The computational architecture of cortex, for example, is very similar from one area to another and the types, arrangements, and connections of cortical neurons are highly stereotyped. This supports the idea that each cortical area conducts calculations using similarly structured neuronal modules: what we term canonical computational motifs. In addition, the remarkable self-similarity of the brain observables at the micro-, meso- and macro-scale further suggests that these motifs are repeated at increasing spatial and temporal scales supporting brain activity from primary motor and sensory processing to higher-level behaviour and cognition. Here, we briefly review the biological bases of canonical brain circuits and the role of inhibitory interneurons in these computational elements. We then elucidate how canonical computational motifs can be repeated across spatial and temporal scales to build a multiplexing information system able to encode and transmit information of increasing complexity. We point to the similarities between the patterns of activation observed in primary sensory cortices by use of electrophysiology and those observed in large scale networks measured with fMRI. We then employ the canonical model of brain function to unify seemingly disparate evidence on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in a single explanatory framework. We hypothesise that such a framework may also be extended to cover multiple brain disorders which are grounded in dysfunction of GABA interneurons and/or these computational motifs.},

  abstract    = {Cannabinoids have been shown to critically modulate cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, yet opposing effects of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) agonists on hippocampal synaptic acetylcholine (ACh) efflux have been reported. This study shows that administration of a synthetic CB1R agonist results in a biphasic, dose-dependent, effect on hippocampal ACh: a low (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and a high (5 mg/kg, i.p) dose of WIN55,212-2 induces a transient stimulation and a prolonged inhibition of hippocampal ACh efflux, respectively. Both effects of WIN55,212-2 are mediated through CB1 receptors coupled to Gi but involve different neuroanatomical sites. Thus, intrahippocampal infusion of the CB1R antagonist SR141716A or pertussis toxin blocked the inhibition of hippocampal ACh release induced by the high dose of WIN55,212-2, but was without effect on the stimulatory action of the low dose. In contrast, this latter effect was blocked by SR141716A or pertussis toxin infused, in dual microdialysis experiments, in the septum, in which the majority of cholinergic cell bodies projecting to the hippocampus reside. The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of WIN55,212-2 on hippocampal ACh involve dopamine D1 and D2 receptor activation, respectively, given that pretreatment with D1 and D2 receptor antagonists prevents the respective actions of WIN55,212-2. We propose that the in vivo observed biphasic effects of CB1R agonists on hippocampal ACh release result from a differential, functional association of anatomicaly distinct subpopulations of CB1-Gi coupled receptors to neurotransmitter systems that have opposing effects on ACh release. This concept could provide a theoretical framework to understand endocannabinoids as state-dependent modulators of neuronal activity.},

  abstract    = {2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the endocannabinoid that mediates retrograde suppression of neurotransmission in the brain. In the present study, we investigated the 2-AG signaling system at mossy cell (MC)-granule cell (GC) synapses in the mouse dentate gyrus, an excitatory recurrent circuit where endocannabinoids are thought to suppress epileptogenesis. First, we showed by electrophysiology that 2-AG produced by diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα) mediated both depolarization-induced suppression of excitation and its enhancement by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor activation at MC-GC synapses, as they were abolished in DGLα-knock-out mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that DGLα was enriched in the neck portion of GC spines forming synapses with MC terminals, whereas cannabinoid CB(1) receptors accumulated in the terminal portion of MC axons. On the other hand, the major 2-AG-degrading enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), was absent at MC-GC synapses but was expressed in astrocytes and some inhibitory terminals. Serial electron microscopy clarified that a given GC spine was innervated by a single MC terminal and also contacted nonsynaptically by other MC terminals making synapses with other GC spines in the neighborhood. MGL-expressing elements, however, poorly covered GC spines, amounting to 17\% of the total surface of GC spines by astrocytes and 4\% by inhibitory terminals. Our findings provide a basis for 2-AG-mediated retrograde suppression of MC-GC synaptic transmission and also suggest that 2-AG released from activated GC spines is readily accessible to nearby MC-GC synapses by escaping from enzymatic degradation. This molecular-anatomical configuration will contribute to adjust network activity in the dentate gyrus after enhanced excitation.},

Neural oscillations are a fundamental mechanism for the establishment of precise temporal relationships between neuronal responses that are in turn relevant for memory, perception and consciousness. In patients with schizophrenia, the synchronization of beta- and gamma-band activity is abnormal, suggesting a crucial role for dysfunctional oscillations in the generation of the cognitive deficits and other symptoms of the disorder. Dysfunctional oscillations may arise owing to anomalies in the brain's rhythm-generating networks of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons and in cortico-cortical connections.},

Recent evidence has indicated that schizophrenia is associated with abnormal amplitude and synchrony of oscillatory activity, in particular, at high (beta/gamma) frequencies. These abnormalities are observed during task-related and spontaneous neuronal activity which may be important for understanding the pathophysiology of the syndrome. In this paper, we shall review the current evidence for impaired beta/gamma-band oscillations and their involvement in cognitive functions and certain symptoms of the disorder. In the first part, we will provide an update on neural oscillations during normal brain functions and discuss underlying mechanisms. This will be followed by a review of studies that have examined high-frequency oscillatory activity in schizophrenia and discuss evidence that relates abnormalities of oscillatory activity to disturbed excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Finally, we shall identify critical issues for future research in this area.Abstract available from the publisher.Abstract available from the publisher.},

  abstract    = {A considerable body of work over the last 10 years combining noninvasive electrophysiology (electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) in patient populations with preclinical research has contributed to the conceptualization of schizophrenia as a disorder associated with aberrant neural dynamics and disturbances in excitation/inhibition balance. This complements previous research that has largely focused on the identification of abnormalities in circumscribed brain regions and on disturbances of dopaminergic mechanisms as a cause of positive symptoms and executive deficits. In the current review, we provide an update on studies focusing on aberrant neural dynamics. First, we discuss the role of rhythmic activity in neural dynamics and in the coordination of distributed neuronal activity into organized neural states. This is followed by an overview on the current evidence for impaired neural oscillations and synchrony in schizophrenia and associated abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acidergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Finally, we discuss the distinction between fundamental symptoms, which are reflected in cognitive deficits, and psychotic, accessory symptoms, the latter likely constituting a compensatory response for aberrant neuronal dynamics.},

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has been implicated in reward processing in animals, but in humans, the relation between eCB functioning and reward is less clear.The current study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the role of the eCB system in reward processing in humans by examining the effect of the eCB agonist Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on reward-related brain activity.Eleven healthy males participated in a randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological fMRI study with administration of THC to challenge the eCB system. We compared anticipatory and feedback-related brain activity after placebo and THC, using a monetary incentive delay task. In this task, subjects are notified before each trial whether a correct response is rewarded ("reward trial") or not ("neutral trial").Subjects showed faster reaction times during reward trials compared to neutral trials, and this effect was not altered by THC. THC induced a widespread attenuation of the brain response to feedback in reward trials but not in neutral trials. Anticipatory brain activity was not affected.These results suggest a role for the eCB system in the appreciation of rewards. The involvement of the eCB system in feedback processing may be relevant for disorders in which appreciation of natural rewards may be affected such as addiction.},

Although this modulatory effect is thought to be mediated mainly by slow nonsynaptic metabotropic receptors, other mechanisms, such as direct synaptic transmission, are possible. Yet, it is currently unknown if any such form of subcortical control exists. Here, we present direct evidence of a strong, spatiotemporally precise excitatory input from an ascending neuromodulatory center. Selective stimulation of serotonergic median raphe neurons produced a rapid activation of hippocampal interneurons. At the network level, this subcortical drive was manifested as a pattern of effective disynaptic GABAergic inhibition that spread throughout the circuit. This form of subcortical network regulation should be incorporated into current concepts of normal and pathological cortical function.},

Although some studies have found that disorganization is more strongly linked to neurocognitive deficits and poor functional outcomes than reality distortion, the findings are not always consistent.A meta-analysis of 104 studies (combined n=8015) was conducted to determine the magnitude of the relationship between neurocognition and disorganization as compared to reality distortion. Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the strength of these relationships differed depending on the neurocognitive domain under investigation.The relationship between reality distortion and neurocognition was weak (r=-.04; p=.03) as compared to the moderate association between disorganization and neurocognition (r=-.23; p<.01). In each of the six neurocognitive domains that were examined, disorganization was more strongly related to neurocognition (r's range from -.20 to -.26) than to reality distortion (r's range from .01 to -.12).The effect size of the relationship between neurocognition and disorganization was significantly larger than the effect size of the relationship between neurocognition and reality distortion. These results hold across several neurocognitive domains. These findings support a dimensional view of positive symptoms distinguishing disorganization from reality distortion.},

  abstract    = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the targets of a large number of drugs currently in therapeutic use. Likewise, the glutamate ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has been implicated in certain neurological disorders, such as neurodegeration, neuropathic pain and mood disorders, as well as psychosis and schizophrenia. Thus, there is now an important need to characterize the interactions between GPCRs and NMDARs. Indeed, these interactions can produce distinct effects, and whereas the activation of Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) increases the calcium fluxes associated to NMDARs, that of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CNR1) antagonizes their permeation. Notably, a series of proteins interact with these receptors affecting their responses and interactions, and then emerge as novel therapeutic targets for the aforementioned pathologies.We found that in the presence of GPCRs, the HINT1 protein influences the activity of NMDARs, whereby NMDAR activation was enhanced in CNR1+/+/HINT1-/- cortical neurons and the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 provided these cells with no protection against a NMDA insult. NMDAR activity was normalized in these cells by the lentiviral expression of HINT1, which also restored the neuroprotection mediated by cannabinoids. NMDAR activity was also enhanced in CNR1-/-/HINT1+/+ neurons, although this activity was dampened by the expression of GPCRs like the MOR, CNR1 or serotonin 1A (5HT1AR).The HINT1 protein plays an essential role in the GPCR-NMDAR connection. In the absence of receptor activation, GPCRs collaborate with HINT1 proteins to negatively control NMDAR activity. When activated, most GPCRs release the control of HINT1 and NMDAR responsiveness is enhanced. However, cannabinoids that act through CNR1 maintain the negative control of HINT1 on NMDAR function and their protection against glutamate excitotoxic insult persists.},

  abstract    = {Selective optogenetic drive of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons (INs) leads to enhanced local field potential (LFP) power across the traditional "gamma" frequency band (20-80 Hz; Cardin et al., 2009). In contrast, drive to regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal cells enhances power at lower frequencies, with a peak at 8 Hz. The first result is consistent with previous computational studies emphasizing the role of FS and the time constant of GABA(A) synaptic inhibition in gamma rhythmicity. However, the same theoretical models do not typically predict low-frequency LFP enhancement with RS drive. To develop hypotheses as to how the same network can support these contrasting behaviors, we constructed a biophysically principled network model of primary somatosensory neocortex containing FS, RS, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) INs. Cells were modeled with detailed cell anatomy and physiology, multiple dendritic compartments, and included active somatic and dendritic ionic currents. Consistent with prior studies, the model demonstrated gamma resonance during FS drive, dependent on the time constant of GABA(A) inhibition induced by synchronous FS activity. Lower-frequency enhancement during RS drive was replicated only on inclusion of an inhibitory LTS population, whose activation was critically dependent on RS synchrony and evoked longer-lasting inhibition. Our results predict that differential recruitment of FS and LTS inhibitory populations is essential to the observed cortical dynamics and may provide a means for amplifying the natural expression of distinct oscillations in normal cortical processing.},

  abstract    = {Processing of multimodal sensory information by the morphological subdivisions of the hippocampus and its input and output structures was investigated in unanesthetized rabbits by extracellular recording of neuronal activity. Analysis shows principal differences between CA3 neurons with uniform multimodal, mainly inhibitory, rapidly habituating sensory responses, and CA1-subicular neurons, substantial parts of which have phasic reactions and patterned on-responses, depending on the characteristics of the stimuli. These differences result from the organization of the afferent inputs to CA1 and CA3. Analysis of neuronal responses in sources of hippocampal inputs, their electrical stimulation, and chronic disconnection show the greater functional significance of the brain-stem reticular input for tonic responses characteristic of CA3. This input signal before entering the hippocampus is additionally preprocessed at the MS-DB relay, where it becomes more uniform and frequency-modulated in the range of theta-rhythm. It is shown that the new sensory stimuli produce inhibitory reset, after which synchronized theta-modulation is triggered. Other stimuli, appearing at the background of the ongoing theta, do not evoke any responses of the hippocampal neurons. Thus, theta-modulation can be regarded as a mechanism of attention, which prolongs response to a selected stimulus and simultaneously protects its processing against interference. The cortical input of the hippocampus introduces highly differentiated information analyzed at the highest levels of the neocortex through the intermediary of the entorhinal cortex and presubiculum. However, only CA1-subiculum receives this information directly; before its entrance into CA3, it is additionally preprocessed at the FD relay, where the secondary simplification of signals occurs. As a result, CA3 receives by its two inputs (MS-DB and FD) messages just about the presence and level of input signals in each of them, and performs relatively simple functions of determination of match/mismatch of their weights. For this comparator system, the presence of signal only in the reticulo-septal input is equivalent to quality of novelty. The cortical signal appears with some delay, after its analysis in the neocortex and shaping in the prehippocampal structures; besides, it is gradually increased due to LTP-like incremental changes in PP and mossy fiber synapses. The CA3 neurons with potentiated synapses of cortical input do not respond to sensory stimuli; that is, the increased efficacy of the cortical signals can be regarded as "familiarity" of a signal, terminating the reactive state of the CA3 neurons. The integrity of both inputs is necessary for gradual habituation of sensory responses in the hippocampus. The output signals of CA3 following in the precommissural fornix to the output relay-LS nucleus and to the brain-stem structures have strong regulatory influence on the level of brain activity (arousal), which is an important condition for processing and registration of information. The primary targets of this output signal are raphe nuclei, which suppress activity of the ascending excitatory RF. In the background state, activity of the CA3 neurons through the intermediary of raphe keeps RF under tonic inhibitory control. Inhibition of the majority of CA3 pyramidal neurons during a novel stimulus action decreases the volume of its output signal to raphe and releases RF from tonic inhibition (increase in level of activity of the forebrain, arousal). When the responses of CA3 neurons habituate, the initial high background activity is reinstated, as well as tonic suppression of RF. Analysis of the second output of CA3 (by Schaffer's collaterals to CA1) shows that activity in this pathway can block access of cortical signals from PP to CA1 neurons by action upon the local system of inhibitory neurons, or by shunting the propagation of signals in apical dendrites. Thus, CA3 can act as a filter controlling the information transmission by CA1; such transmission at any given moment is allowed only in those CA1 neurons which receive SC from CA3 neurons, responding to the sensory stimulus by suppression of their activity. Disconnection of the CA3 output fibers results in disappearance of habituation in all its target structures (raphe, RF, CA1). The output signal of CA1-subiculum follows by postcommissural fornix to the chain of structures of the main limbic circuit: mammillary bodies (medial nucleus), anterior thalamic nuclei (mainly antero-ventral nucleus), and cingulate limbic cortex (mainly posterior area). In each of these links, the signal is additionally processed. Habituation is nearly absent in these structures; instead, st},

It implicates various deficits of perceptual and attentional functions, and this inability to inhibit, or "gate", irrelevant sensory inputs leads to sensory and information overload that also may result in neuronal hyperexcitability related to disturbances of habituation mechanisms. These findings seem to be particularly important in the context of modern electrophysiological and neuroimaging data suggesting that the filtering deficits in schizophrenia are likely related to deficits in the integrity of connections between various brain areas. As a consequence, this brain disintegration produces disconnection of information, disrupted binding, and disintegration of consciousness that in terms of modern neuroscience could connect original Bleuler's concept of "split mind" with research of neural information integration.},

  abstract    = {Cannabis use has been reported to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and to worsen symptoms of the illness. Both of these outcomes might be attributable to the disruption by cannabis of the endogenous cannabinoid system's spatiotemporal regulation of the inhibitory circuitry in the prefrontal cortex that is essential for core cognitive processes, such as working memory, which are impaired in schizophrenia. In the healthy brain, the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol 1) is synthesized by diacylglycerol lipase in pyramidal neurons; 2) travels retrogradely to nearby inhibitory axon terminals that express the primary type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R); 3) binds to CB1R, which inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid release from the cholecystokinin-containing population of interneurons; and 4) is metabolized by either monoglyceride lipase, which is located in the inhibitory axon terminal, or by α-β-hydrolase domain 6, which is co-localized presynaptically with diacylglycerol lipase. Investigations of the endogenous cannabinoid system in the prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia have found evidence of higher metabolism of 2-arachidonylglycerol, as well as both greater CB1R receptor binding and lower levels of CB1R messenger RNA and protein. Current views on the potential pathogenesis of these alterations, including disturbances in the development of the endogenous cannabinoid system, are discussed. In addition, how interactions between these alterations in the endocannabinoid system and those in other inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex in subjects with schizophrenia might increase the liability to adverse outcomes with cannabis use is considered.},

Here we assessed the balance between D1 or D2 receptor signaling in the human brain and how it is affected in alcoholism. Using PET, we measured the relationship between changes in dopamine and brain glucose metabolism induced by methylphenidate in controls and alcoholics. We show that methylphenidate induced significant DA increases in striatum, amygdala, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, whereas it decreased metabolism in these brain regions. Methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases were greater in controls than in alcoholics, whereas methylphenidate-induced metabolic decreases were greater in alcoholics. For both groups, methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases were associated with decreases in regional brain metabolism, and the correlations were strongest in subthalamic nuclei, anterior cingulate, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. These correlations were more extensive and robust and the slopes steeper in alcoholics than in controls despite their attenuated dopamine responses to methylphenidate, which suggests an impaired modulation of dopamine signals in the brain of alcoholic subjects. These findings are consistent with a predominant inhibitory effect of dopamine in the human brain that is likely mediated by the prominence of dopamine D2/D3 receptors.},

However, the pathomechanism whereby cannabis use increases this risk has not yet been identified. We argue that this pathomechanism may involve direct effects of exogenous cannabinoids on T-type calcium channels in the thalamus. These channels are crucial for amplification of corticothalamic inputs, as well as for the ability of the thalamus to generate neuronal burst firing. Cortically induced thalamic burst firing has been found to be important in trans-thalamic cortico-cortical interactions. Therefore, any potential interference with the burst firing mode in the thalamus could lead to an impairment in these interactions, which in turn causes a relative disconnection between cortical areas. This in turn could result in reduced ability to recognize re-afferent sensory inputs and psychosis. We also argue that the effects of Δ(9)THC are more detrimental compared with the effects of cannabidiol, as the former may increase the excitability of thalamic neurons by its direct effect on T-type calcium channels.},

A sizable body of previous work showed that cannabinoid agonists suppress pain behavior in a variety of models of acute and chronic pain. However, at appropriate doses, cannabinoids also profoundly suppress motor behavior (see Sañudo-Peña et al., this volume), which complicates the interpretation of behavioral analgesia since a motor response is the endpoint of virtually all such studies. Studies conducted in this laboratory used biochemical and neurophysiological measures to determine whether cannabinoids suppress nociceptive neurotransmission. The results showed that cannabinoids suppress nociceptive neurotransmission at the level of the spinal cord and the thalamus. These effects are reversible, receptor mediated, selective for painful as opposed to nonpainful somatic stimuli, and track the behavioral analgesia both in time course and potency.},

Whole cell patch clamp recording, Ca(2+) measurement with ratiometric fluorescent dyes and photolysis of caged Ca(2+) were combined to investigate the depolarization- and photolysis-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI and PSI) in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. 2. A 5-s depolarization from -70 mV to 0 mV or a 6-s photolysis of nitrophenyl-EGTA (NPE) in cell bodies could each depress the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and the amplitude of evoked IPSCs while elevating intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). 3. Within a cell the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) induced by depolarization was inversely related to that induced by photolysis, suggesting that higher [NPE] is more effective in releasing caged Ca(2+) but also increases buffer capacity to reduce [Ca(2+)](i) rises caused by Ca(2+) influx through voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. 4. Both DSI and PSI were linearly related to [Ca(2+)](i), with a 50 \% reduction in transmission occurring at about 3.6--3.9 microM. 5. [Ca(2+)](i) recovered more quickly than DSI, indicating that the duration of DSI is not set simply by the duration of [Ca(2+)](i) elevation, but rather entails other rate-limiting processes. 6.

  abstract    = {Neurons in the primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) generate persistent firing in the absence of sensory stimulation, the foundation of mental representation. Persistent firing arises from recurrent excitation within a network of pyramidal Delay cells. Here, we examined glutamate receptor influences underlying persistent firing in primate dlPFC during a spatial working memory task. Computational models predicted dependence on NMDA receptor (NMDAR) NR2B stimulation, and Delay cell persistent firing was abolished by local NR2B NMDAR blockade or by systemic ketamine administration. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) contributed background depolarization to sustain network firing. In contrast, many Response cells were sensitive to AMPAR blockade and increased firing after systemic ketamine, indicating that models of ketamine actions should be refined to reflect neuronal heterogeneity. The reliance of Delay cells on NMDAR may explain why insults to NMDARs in schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease profoundly impair cognition.},

Its cellular mechanisms remain a matter of debate, and previous computational work has focused mostly on mechanisms intrinsic to the hippocampus. On the other hand, experimental data indicate that GABAergic cells in the medial septum play a pacemaker role for the theta rhythm. We have used biophysical modeling to address two major questions raised by the septal pacemaker hypothesis: what is the ion channel mechanism for the single-cell pacemaker behavior and how do these cells become synchronized? Our model predicts that theta oscillations of septal GABAergic cells depend critically on a low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current. Network simulations show that theta oscillations are not coherent in an isolated population of pacemaker cells. Robust synchronization emerges with the addition of a second GABAergic cell population. Such a reciprocally inhibitory circuit can be realized by the hippocampo-septal feedback loop.},

  abstract    = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

The brain is enormously complex and its abundant feedback loops on multiple scales preclude intuitive explication of circuit functions. In close interplay with experiments, theory and computational modeling are essential for understanding how, precisely, neural circuits generate flexible behaviors and their impairments give rise to psychiatric symptoms. This Perspective highlights recent progress in applying computational neuroscience to the study of mental disorders. We outline basic approaches, including identification of core deficits that cut across disease categories, biologically realistic modeling bridging cellular and synaptic mechanisms with behavior, and model-aided diagnosis. The need for new research strategies in psychiatry is urgent. Computational psychiatry potentially provides powerful tools for elucidating pathophysiology that may inform both diagnosis and treatment. To achieve this promise will require investment in cross-disciplinary training and research in this nascent field.},

Here we propose a local cortical circuit in which three major subtypes of interneurons play distinct roles. In a model designed for spatial working memory, stimulus tuning of persistent activity arises from the concerted action of widespread inhibition mediated by perisoma-targeting (parvalbumin-containing) interneurons and localized disinhibition of pyramidal cells via interneuron-targeting (calretinin-containing) interneurons. Moreover, resistance against distracting stimuli (a fundamental property of working memory) is dynamically controlled by dendrite-targeting (calbindin-containing) interneurons. The experimental observation of inverted tuning curves of monkey prefrontal neurons recorded during working memory supports a key model prediction. This work suggests a framework for understanding the division of labor and cooperation among different inhibitory cell types in a recurrent cortical circuit.},

  abstract  = {Learning does not only depend on rationality, because real-life learning cannot be isolated from emotion or social factors. Therefore, it is intriguing to determine how emotion changes learning, and to identify which neural substrates underlie this interaction. Here, we show that the task-independent presentation of an emotional face before a reward-predicting cue increases the speed of cue–reward association learning in human subjects compared with trials in which a neutral face is presented. This phenomenon was attributable to an increase in the learning rate, which regulates reward prediction errors. Parallel to these behavioral findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that presentation of an emotional face enhanced reward prediction error (RPE) signal in the ventral striatum. In addition, we also found a functional link between this enhanced RPE signal and increased activity in the amygdala following presentation of an emotional face. Thus, this study revealed an acceleration of cue–reward association learning by emotion, and underscored a role of striatum–amygdala interactions in the modulation of the reward prediction errors by emotion.},

Participants completed three separate pharmacological challenge sessions (ketamine, thiopental, saline) in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were recorded both before and during each challenge while participants performed a visual 'oddball' task consisting of infrequent 'target' and 'novel' stimuli intermixed with frequent 'standard' stimuli. We examined drug effects on the amplitude and latency of the P300 (P3) component of the ERP elicited by target (P3b) and novel stimuli (P3a), as well as the N200 (N2) component elicited by both target and novel stimuli, and the N100 (N1) elicited by standard stimuli. Relative to placebo, both drugs reduced the amplitude of parietal P3b. While both drugs reduced parietal P3a and Novelty N2, ketamine also shortened P3a latency, reduced Novelty N2 amplitude more than thiopental, and increased frontal P3a amplitude relative to placebo. Overall, the data suggest that both the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems modulate P3b and P3a. NMDA antagonism appears to lead to more varied effects on the neural correlates of novelty processing.},

  abstract    = {During active exploration, hippocampal neurons exhibit nested rhythmic activity at theta ( approximately 8 Hz) and gamma ( approximately 40 Hz) frequencies. Gamma rhythms may be generated locally by interactions within a class of interneurons mediating fast GABA(A) (GABA(A,fast)) inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), whereas theta rhythms traditionally are thought to be imposed extrinsically. However, the hippocampus contains slow biophysical mechanisms that may contribute to the theta rhythm, either as a resonance activated by extrinsic input or as a purely local phenomenon. For example, region CA1 of the hippocampus contains a slower class of GABA(A) (GABA(A,slow)) synapses, believed to be generated by a distinct group of interneurons. Recent evidence indicates that these GABA(A,slow) interneurons project to the GABA(A, fast) interneurons that contribute to hippocampal gamma rhythms. Here, we use biophysically based simulations to explore the possible ramifications of interneuronal circuits containing separate classes of GABA(A,fast) and GABA(A,slow) interneurons. Simulated interneuronal networks with fast and slow synaptic kinetics can generate mixed theta-gamma rhythmicity under restricted conditions, including strong connections among each population, weaker connections between the two populations, and homogeneity of cellular properties and drive. Under a broader range of conditions, including heterogeneity, the networks can amplify and resynchronize phasic responses to weak phase-dispersed external drive at theta frequencies to either GABA(A,slow) or GABA(A,fast) cells. GABA(A, slow) synapses are necessary for this process of amplification and resynchronization.},

Their dynamic properties permit the synchronization of neuronal responses to sensory input within spatially distributed networks, transient formation of local neuronal "cell assemblies," and coherent response patterns essential for intercortical regional communication. Each of these phenomena form part of a working hypothesis for cognitive function in cortex. All forms of physiological gamma rhythm are inhibition based, being characterized by rhythmic trains of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in populations of principal neurons. It is these repeating periods of relative enhancement and attenuation of the responsivity of major cell groups in cortex that provides a temporal structure shared across many millions of neurons. However, when considering the origins of these repeating trains of inhibitory events considerable divergence is seen depending on cortical region studied and mode of activation of gamma rhythm generating networks. Here, we review the evidence for involvement of multiple subtypes of interneuron and focus on different modes of activation of these cells. We conclude that most massively parallel brain regions have different mechanisms of gamma rhythm generation, that different mechanisms have distinct functional correlates, and that switching between different local modes of gamma generation may be an effective way to direct cortical communication streams. Finally, we suggest that developmental disruption of the endophenotype for certain subsets of gamma-generating interneuron may underlie cognitive deficit in psychiatric illness.},

In the latter case, stable patterns of interneuron output, and their postsynaptic consequences for pyramidal cell membrane potential, occur despite known constraints of synaptic habituation and potentiation.

  abstract    = {This article describes a comprehensive meta-analysis that was conducted to estimate the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). A systematic literature review identified 86 studies of children and adolescents (N = 163,688 individuals) and 11 studies of adults (N = 14,112 individuals) that met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, more than half of which were published after the only previous meta-analysis of the prevalence of ADHD was completed. Although prevalence estimates reported by individual studies varied widely, pooled results suggest that the prevalence of DSM-IV ADHD is similar, whether ADHD is defined by parent ratings, teacher ratings, or a best estimate diagnostic procedure in children and adolescents (5.9-7.1 \%), or by self-report measures in young adults (5.0 \%). Analyses of diagnostic subtypes indicated that the predominantly inattentive type is the most common subtype in the population, but individuals with the combined type are more likely to be referred for clinical services. Additional research is needed to determine the etiology of the higher prevalence of ADHD in males than females and to clarify whether the prevalence of ADHD varies as a function of socioeconomic status or ethnicity. Finally, there were no significant prevalent differences between countries or regions of the world after controlling for differences in the diagnostic algorithms used to define ADHD. These results provide important support for the diagnostic validity of ADHD, and argue against the hypothesis that ADHD is a cultural construct that is restricted to the United States or any other specific culture.},

  abstract    = {We describe a phenomenon of hyperpolarization-activated graded persistent activity (HAGPA) in prefrontal cortex neurons. Successive hyperpolarizing pulses induced increasingly higher rates of tonic firing that remained stable for tens of seconds, allowing the neuron to retain a memory of the previous history of stimulation. This phenomenon occurred at the cellular level and in the absence of neuromodulators. Neurons with HAGPA had a sag during hyperpolarization, and blocking h-current eliminated the sag and prevented HAGPA, suggesting that the activation of this hyperpolarization-activated cationic current was necessary for the occurrence of the phenomenon. A single-neuron biophysical model including h-current modulation by intracellular calcium was able to display HAGPA. This form of neuronal memory not only allows the transformation of inhibition into an increase of firing rate, but also endows neurons with a mechanism to compute the properties of successive inputs into persistent activity, thus solving a difficult computational problem.},

  abstract    = {Although the effects of cannabis on perception are well documented, little is known about their neural basis or how these may contribute to the formation of psychotic symptoms. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) during visual and auditory processing in healthy volunteers. In total, 14 healthy volunteers were scanned on three occasions. Identical 10 mg THC, 600 mg CBD, and placebo capsules were allocated in a balanced double-blinded pseudo-randomized crossover design. Plasma levels of each substance, physiological parameters, and measures of psychopathology were taken at baseline and at regular intervals following ingestion of substances. Volunteers listened passively to words read and viewed a radial visual checkerboard in alternating blocks during fMRI scanning. Administration of THC was associated with increases in anxiety, intoxication, and positive psychotic symptoms, whereas CBD had no significant symptomatic effects. THC decreased activation relative to placebo in bilateral temporal cortices during auditory processing, and increased and decreased activation in different visual areas during visual processing. CBD was associated with activation in right temporal cortex during auditory processing, and when contrasted, THC and CBD had opposite effects in the right posterior superior temporal gyrus, the right-sided homolog to Wernicke's area. Moreover, the attenuation of activation in this area (maximum 61, -15, -2) by THC during auditory processing was correlated with its acute effect on psychotic symptoms. Single doses of THC and CBD differently modulate brain function in areas that process auditory and visual stimuli and relate to induced psychotic symptoms.},

The data reviewed strongly support this notion but in addition point to connectional heterogeneities that may point to functional specializations in CA3, on top of its role as an autoassociative network uniquely relevant to efficient encoding and recall of information.},

To elucidate the connections between hippocampal principal cells and various classes of interneurons, CA3 pyramidal cells were intracellularly labelled with biocytin in anaesthetized rats and the three-dimensional distribution of their axon collaterals was reconstructed. The sections were double-stained for substance P receptor (SPR)- or metabotropic glutamate receptor 1alpha (mGluR-1alpha)-immunoreactivity to investigate interneuron targets of the CA3 pyramidal cells. SPR-containing interneurons represent a large portion of the GABAergic population, including spiny and aspiny classes. Axon terminals of CA3 pyramidal cells contacted SPR-positive interneuron dendrites in the hilus and in all hippocampal strata in both CA3 and CA1 regions (7.16\% of all boutons). The majority of axons formed single contacts (87.5\%), but multiple contacts (up to six) on single target neurons were also found. CA3 pyramidal cell axon collaterals innervated several types of morphologically different aspiny SPR-positive interneurons. In contrast, spiny SPR-interneurons or mGluR-1alpha-positive interneurons in the hilus, CA3 and CA1 regions were rarely contacted by the filled pyramidal cells. These findings indicate a strong target selection of CA3 pyramidal cells favouring the activation of aspiny classes of interneurons.},

The neuron was filled with biocytin in an anesthetized rat and the collaterals were reconstructed with the aid of a NeuroLucida program from 48 coronal sections. The total length of the axon collaterals exceeded 0.5 m, with almost 40,000 synaptic boutons. The majority of the collaterals were present in the CA1 region (70.0\%), whereas 27.6\% constituted CA3 recurrent collaterals with the remaining minority of axons returning to the dentate gyrus. The axon arbor covered more than two thirds of the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, and the terminals were randomly distributed both locally and distally from the soma. We suggest that the CA3 system can be conceptualized as a single-module, in which nearby and distant targets are contacted by the same probability (similar to a mathematically defined random graph). This arrangement, in combination with the parallel input granule cells and parallel output CA1 pyramidal cells, appears ideal for segregation and integration of information and memories.},

  abstract    = {We describe a computational model of the principal cell in the nucleus accumbens (NAcb), the medium spiny projection (MSP) neuron. The model neuron, constructed in NEURON, includes all of the known ionic currents in these cells and receives synaptic input from simulated spike trains via NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA receptors. After tuning the model by adjusting maximal current conductances in each compartment, the model cell closely matched whole-cell recordings from an adult rat NAcb slice preparation. Synaptic inputs in the range of 1000-1300 Hz are required to maintain an "up" state in the model. Cell firing in the model required concurrent depolarization of several dendritic branches, which responded independently to afferent input. Depolarization from action potentials traveled to the tips of the dendritic branches and increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. As NMDA/AMPA current ratios were increased, the membrane showed an increase in hysteresis of "up" and "down" state dwell times, but intrinsic bistability was not observed. The number of oscillatory inputs required to entrain the model cell was determined to be approximately 20\% of the "up" state inputs. Altering the NMDA/AMPA ratio had a profound effect on processing of afferent input, including the ability to entrain to oscillations in afferent input in the theta range (4-12 Hz). These results suggest that afferent information integration by the NAcb MSP cell may be compromised by pathology in which the NMDA current is altered or modulated, as has been proposed in both schizophrenia and addiction.},

  abstract    = {Brain circuitry processes information by rapidly and selectively engaging functional neuronal networks. The dynamic formation of networks is often evident in rhythmically synchronized neuronal activity and tightly correlates with perceptual, cognitive and motor performances. But how synchronized neuronal activity contributes to network formation and how it relates to the computation of behaviorally relevant information has remained difficult to discern. Here we structure recent empirical advances that link synchronized activity to the activation of so-called dynamic circuit motifs. These motifs explicitly relate (1) synaptic and cellular properties of circuits to (2) identified timescales of rhythmic activation and to (3) canonical circuit computations implemented by rhythmically synchronized circuits. We survey the ubiquitous evidence of specific cell and circuit properties underlying synchronized activity across theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands and show that their activation likely implements gain control, context-dependent gating and state-specific integration of synaptic inputs. This evidence gives rise to the dynamic circuit motifs hypothesis of synchronized activation states, with its core assertion that activation states are linked to uniquely identifiable local circuit structures that are recruited during the formation of functional networks to perform specific computational operations.},

  abstract    = {We studied the distribution, morphology, ultrastructure and connectivity of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the entorhinal cortex of the rat. Immunoreactive cell bodies were found in all layers of the entorhinal cortex except layer I. The highest numbers were observed in layers II and III of the dorsal division of the lateral entorhinal area whereas the lowest numbers occurred in the ventral division of the lateral entorhinal area. Most such neurons displayed multipolar configurations with smooth dendrites. We distinguished a type with long dendrites and a type with short dendrites. We also observed pyramidal immunoreactive neurons. A dense plexus of immunoreactive dendrites and axons was prominent in layers II and III of the dorsal division of the lateral entorhinal area and the medial entorhinal area. None of the parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells became retrogradely labelled after injection of horseradish peroxidase into the hippocampal formation. By electron microscopy, immunoreactivity was observed in cell bodies, dendrites, myelinated and unmyelinated axons and axon terminals. Immunoreactive dendrites and axons occurred in all cortical layers. We noted many myelinated immunoreactive axons. Immunoreactive axon terminals were medium sized, contained pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, and established symmetrical synapses. Both horseradish peroxidase labelled and unlabelled immunonegative cell bodies often received synapses from immunopositive axon terminals arranged in baskets. Synapses between immunoreactive axon terminals and unlabelled dendritic shafts and spines were abundant. Synapses with initial axon segments occurred less frequently. In addition, synaptic contacts were present between immunopositive axon terminals and cell bodies and dendrites. Thus, the several types of parvalbumin-containing neuron in the entorhinal cortex are interneurons, connected to one another and to immunonegative neurons through a network of synaptic contacts. Immunonegative cells projecting to the hippocampal formation receive axo-somatic basket synapses from immunopositive terminals. This connectivity may form the morphological substrate underlying the reported strong inhibition of cells in layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex projecting to the hippocampal formation.},

  abstract    = {The quantification of experimentally-induced alterations in biological pathways remains a major challenge in systems biology. One example of this is the quantitative characterization of alterations in defined, established metabolic pathways from complex metabolomic data. At present, the disruption of a given metabolic pathway is inferred from metabolomic data by observing an alteration in the level of one or more individual metabolites present within that pathway. Not only is this approach open to subjectivity, as metabolites participate in multiple pathways, but it also ignores useful information available through the pairwise correlations between metabolites. This extra information may be incorporated using a higher-level approach that looks for alterations between a pair of correlation networks. In this way experimentally-induced alterations in metabolic pathways can be quantitatively defined by characterizing group differences in metabolite clustering. Taking this approach increases the objectivity of interpreting alterations in metabolic pathways from metabolomic data.We present and justify a new technique for comparing pairs of networks--in our case these networks are based on the same set of nodes and there are two distinct types of weighted edges. The algorithm is based on the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD), which may be regarded as an extension of Principle Components Analysis to the case of two data sets. We show how the GSVD can be interpreted as a technique for reordering the two networks in order to reveal clusters that are exclusive to only one. Here we apply this algorithm to a new set of metabolomic data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of a translational model relevant to schizophrenia, rats treated subchronically with the N-methyl-D-Aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). This provides us with a means to quantify which predefined metabolic pathways (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolite pathway database) were altered in the PFC of PCP-treated rats. Several significant changes were discovered, notably: 1) neuroactive ligands active at glutamate and GABA receptors are disrupted in the PFC of PCP-treated animals, 2) glutamate dysfunction in these animals was not limited to compromised glutamatergic neurotransmission but also involves the disruption of metabolic pathways linked to glutamate; and 3) a specific series of purine reactions Xanthine ← Hypoxyanthine ↔ Inosine ← IMP → adenylosuccinate is also disrupted in the PFC of PCP-treated animals.Network reordering via the GSVD provides a means to discover statistically validated differences in clustering between a pair of networks. In practice this analytical approach, when applied to metabolomic data, allows us to quantify the alterations in metabolic pathways between two experimental groups. With this new computational technique we identified metabolic pathway alterations that are consistent with known results. Furthermore, we discovered disruption in a novel series of purine reactions that may contribute to the PFC dysfunction and cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous lipid mediators involved in a variety of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological processes. While activation of the eCB system primarily induces inhibitory effects on both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity through acting on presynaptically expressed CB1 receptors in the brain, accumulated information suggests that eCB signaling is also capable of facilitating or potentiating excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Recent studies show that a long-lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses is induced by spatiotemporally primed inputs, accompanying with a long-term depression of inhibitory synaptic transmission (I-LTD) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. This input timing-dependent long-lasting synaptic potentiation at SC-CA1 synapses is mediated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) signaling triggered by activation of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and a concurrent rise in intracellular Ca(2+). Emerging evidence now also indicates that 2-AG is an important signaling mediator keeping brain homeostasis by exerting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in response to harmful insults through CB1/2 receptor-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms. Activation of the nuclear receptor protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ apparently is one of the important mechanisms in resolving neuroinflammation and protecting neurons produced by 2-AG signaling. Thus, the information summarized in this review suggests that the role of eCB signaling in maintaining integrity of brain function is greater than what we thought previously.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons receive two excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs: their most distal dendritic regions in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) are innervated by the perforant path (PP), originating from layer III of the entorhinal cortex, while their more proximal regions of the apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum (SR) are innervated by the Schaffer-collaterals (SC), originating from hippocampal CA3 neurons. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are naturally occurring mediators capable of modulating both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity via the CB1 receptor. Previous work on eCB modulation of excitatory synapses in the CA1 region largely focuses on the SC pathway. However, little information is available on whether and how eCBs modulate glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity at PP synapses.By employing somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings, Ca(2+) uncaging, and immunostaining, we demonstrate that there are significant differences in low-frequency stimulation (LFS)- or DHPG-, an agonist of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), induced long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory synaptic transmission between SC and PP synapses in the same pyramidal neurons. These differences are eliminated by pharmacological inhibition with selective CB1 receptor antagonists or genetic deletion of the CB1 receptor, indicating that these differences likely result from differential modulation via a CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism. We also revealed that depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a form of short-term synaptic plasticity, and photolysis of caged Ca(2+)-induced suppression of Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were less at the PP than that at the SC. In addition, application of WIN55212 (WIN) induced a more pronounced inhibition of EPSCs at the SC when compared to that at the PP.Our results suggest that CB1 dependent LTD and DSE are differentially expressed at the PP versus SC synapses in the same neurons, which may have an impact on synaptic scaling, integration and plasticity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.},

  abstract    = {Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons receive sensory inputs from the entorhinal cortex directly through the perforant path (PP) and indirectly through Schaffer collaterals (SC). Direct cortical inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons through the PP provide instructive signals for hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity. However, the molecules conveying synaptic signalling in this new form of heterosynaptic plasticity remain unclear. Endocannabinoids, important endogenous signalling mediators, modulate synaptic efficacy primarily through inhibition of GABAergic or glutamatergic synaptic transmission via presynaptically expressed CB1 receptors. Here, we report that pairing of direct and indirect cortical inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons resulted in a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic responses at SC synapses, but not at the PP. The pairing-potentiated synaptic transmission at the SC was accompanied by a reduced ratio of paired-pulse facilitation (PPR). Enhanced synaptic response at the SC by pairing of PP–SC stimuli is Ca(2+) dependent and requires the presence of functional GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmissions and activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of the CB1 receptor eliminated the pairing-induced long-term synaptic plasticity and decreased PPR at the SC. The potentiation induced by pairing of PP–SC stimuli primarily is the glutamatergic synaptic transmission. While the pairing-induced long-lasting potentiation of synaptic response was blocked by inhibitors for diacylglycerol lipase (DGL), which biosynthesizes 2-AG, inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), which metabolizes 2-AG, facilitated the potentiation at SC synapses by pairing of weak PP–SC stimuli. Our results suggest that 2-AG functions as a signalling mediator tuning synaptic efficacy at the proximal synapses of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons while direct and indirect cortical inputs to the same neurons are spatiotemporally primed.},

They are widely expressed throughout the brain, including in the hippocampus where they are thought to be involved in regulating excitability, plasticity, and cognitive function. In addition, dysfunction in hippocampal nAChRs has been linked to a variety of neurological disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. In order to understand how to treat nAChR-related disorders and diseases, it is critical to understand how these receptors participate in normal brain function; this entails not only understanding the biophysical properties of ion channel function and their pattern of expression but also how these receptors are regulating excitability and circuit behavior.The primary cholinergic input to the hippocampus comes from the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca; however, the mechanistic details are unknown of how activation of cholinergic receptors, either through exogenous nAChR ligands or the activation of endogenous acetylcholine release, regulates hippocampal network activity. This entails direct study of the excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks, as well as the role of nonneuronal cells, in regulating hippocampal function.Here, I will review the latest work from my laboratory in which we have attempted to do just that, with the overall goal of learning more about the role of the hippocampal nAChR in synaptic plasticity.},

The primary cholinergic input to the hippocampus arises from the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MS-DBB), and we investigated how their activation regulated hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We found that activation of these endogenous cholinergic inputs can directly induce different forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity with a timing precision in the millisecond range. Furthermore, we observed a prolonged enhancement of excitability both pre- and postsynaptically. Lastly we found that the presence of the α7 nAChR subtype to both pre- and postsynaptic sites appeared to be required to induce this plasticity. We propose that α7 nAChRs coordinate pre- and postsynaptic activities to induce glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, and thus provide a novel mechanism underlying physiological neuronal communication that could lead to timing-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.},

  abstract    = {The cognitive function of the highly evolved dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is greatly influenced by arousal state, and is gravely afflicted in disorders such as schizophrenia, where there are genetic insults in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs). A recent behavioral study indicates that ACh depletion from dlPFC markedly impairs working memory [Croxson PL, Kyriazis DA, Baxter MG (2011) Nat Neurosci 14(12):1510-1512]; however, little is known about how α7-nAChRs influence dlPFC cognitive circuits. Goldman-Rakic [Goldman-Rakic (1995) Neuron 14(3):477-485] discovered the circuit basis for working memory, whereby dlPFC pyramidal cells excite each other through glutamatergic NMDA receptor synapses to generate persistent network firing in the absence of sensory stimulation. Here we explore α7-nAChR localization and actions in primate dlPFC and find that they are enriched in glutamate network synapses, where they are essential for dlPFC persistent firing, with permissive effects on NMDA receptor actions. Blockade of α7-nAChRs markedly reduced, whereas low-dose stimulation selectively enhanced, neuronal representations of visual space. These findings in dlPFC contrast with the primary visual cortex, where nAChR blockade had no effect on neuronal firing [Herrero JL, et al. (2008) Nature 454(7208):1110-1114]. We additionally show that α7-nAChR stimulation is needed for NMDA actions, suggesting that it is key for the engagement of dlPFC circuits. As ACh is released in cortex during waking but not during deep sleep, these findings may explain how ACh shapes differing mental states during wakefulness vs. sleep. The results also explain why genetic insults to α7-nAChR would profoundly disrupt cognitive experience in patients with schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) is an endocannabinoid that is released from postsynaptic neurons, acts retrogradely on presynaptic cannabinoid receptor CB1, and induces short- and long-term suppression of transmitter release. To understand the mechanisms of the 2-AG-mediated retrograde modulation, we investigated subcellular localization of a major 2-AG biosynthetic enzyme, diacylglycerol lipase-alpha (DAGLalpha), by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy in the mouse brain. In the cerebellum, DAGLalpha was predominantly expressed in Purkinje cells. DAGLalpha was detected on the dendritic surface and occasionally on the somatic surface, with a distal-to-proximal gradient from spiny branchlets toward somata. DAGLalpha was highly concentrated at the base of spine neck and also accumulated with much lower density on somatodendritic membrane around the spine neck. However, DAGLalpha was excluded from the main body of spine neck and head. In hippocampal pyramidal cells, DAGLalpha was also accumulated in spines. In contrast to the distribution in Purkinje cells, DAGLalpha was distributed in the spine head, neck, or both, whereas somatodendritic membrane was labeled very weakly. These results indicate that DAGLalpha is essentially targeted to postsynaptic spines in cerebellar and hippocampal neurons, but its fine distribution within and around spines is differently regulated between the two neurons. The preferential spine targeting should enable efficient 2-AG production on excitatory synaptic activity and its swift retrograde modulation onto nearby presynaptic terminals expressing CB1. Furthermore, different fine localization within and around spines suggests that the distance between postsynaptic 2-AG production site and presynaptic CB1 is differentially controlled depending on neuron types.},

  abstract    = {Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is capable of triggering excessive glutamate release and subsequent cortical excitation which may induce psychosis-like behavior and cognitive anomalies. Growing evidence suggests that acute ketamine administration can provoke dose-dependent positive and negative schizophrenia-like symptoms. While the acute effects of ketamine are primarily linked to aberrant activation of the prefrontal cortex and limbic structures with elevated glutamate and dopamine levels, the long-term effects of ketamine on brain functions and neurochemical homeostasis remain incompletely understood. In recent years, reports of ketamine abuse, especially among young individuals, have surged rapidly, with profound socioeconomic and health impacts. We herein investigated the chronic effects of ketamine on brain function integrity in an animal model of adolescent cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Immunohistochemical study was also conducted to examine neurochemical changes in the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in the prefrontal cortex following chronic ketamine administration. Our results suggest that repeated exposure to ketamine markedly reduced neural activities in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra in midbrain, posterior cingulate cortex, and visual cortex in ketamine-challenged monkeys. In contrast, hyperfunction was observed in the striatum and entorhinal cortex. In terms of neurochemical and locomotive changes, chronically ketamine-challenged animals were found to have reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) but not choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) levels in the prefrontal cortex, which was accompanied by diminished total movement compared with the controls. Importantly, the mesolimbic, mesocortical and entorhinal-striatal systems were found to be functionally vulnerable to ketamine's chronic effects. Dysfunctions of these neural circuits have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder (ADD). Collectively, our results support the proposition that repeated ketamine exposure can be exploited as a pharmacological paradigm for studying the central effects of ketamine relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract    = {Memories are believed to be represented in the synaptic pathways of vastly interconnected networks of neurons. The plasticity of synapses, that is, their strengthening and weakening depending on neuronal activity, is believed to be the basis of learning and establishing memories. An increasing number of studies indicate that endocannabinoids have a widespread action on brain function through modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recent experimental studies have characterised the role of endocannabinoids in mediating both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity in various brain regions including the hippocampus, a brain region strongly associated with cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. Here, we present a biophysically plausible model of cannabinoid retrograde signalling at the synaptic level and investigate how this signalling mediates depolarisation induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a prominent form of short-term synaptic depression in inhibitory transmission in hippocampus. The model successfully captures many of the key characteristics of DSI in the hippocampus, as observed experimentally, with a minimal yet sufficient mathematical description of the major signalling molecules and cascades involved. More specifically, this model serves as a framework to test hypotheses on the factors determining the variability of DSI and investigate under which conditions it can be evoked. The model reveals the frequency and duration bands in which the post-synaptic cell can be sufficiently stimulated to elicit DSI. Moreover, the model provides key insights on how the state of the inhibitory cell modulates DSI according to its firing rate and relative timing to the post-synaptic activation. Thus, it provides concrete suggestions to further investigate experimentally how DSI modulates and is modulated by neuronal activity in the brain. Importantly, this model serves as a stepping stone for future deciphering of the role of endocannabinoids in synaptic transmission as a feedback mechanism both at synaptic and network level.},

  abstract    = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) modulate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in hippocampus via activation of pre-synaptic cannabinoid receptors. Here, we present a model for cannabinoid mediated short-term depression of excitation (DSE) based on our recently developed model for the equivalent phenomenon of suppressing inhibition (DSI). Furthermore, we derive a simplified formulation of the calcium-mediated endocannabinoid synthesis that underlies short-term modulation of neurotransmission in hippocampus. The simplified model describes cannabinoid-mediated short-term modulation of both hippocampal inhibition and excitation and is ideally suited for large network studies. Moreover, the implementation of the simplified DSI/DSE model provides predictions on how both phenomena are modulated by the magnitude of the pre-synaptic cell's activity. In addition we demonstrate the role of DSE in shaping the post-synaptic cell's firing behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively in dependence on eCB availability and the pre-synaptic cell's activity. Finally, we explore under which conditions the combination of DSI and DSE can temporarily shift the fine balance between excitation and inhibition. This highlights a mechanism by which eCBs might act in a neuro-protective manner during high neural activity.},

  abstract    = {The Cav2.1 (P/Q-) and Cav2.2 (N-type) voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a predominant role in neurotransmitter release at central synapses, but their distribution is not uniform across different types of synapses. Although the functional significance of the differential distribution of N- and P/Q-type VGCCs is poorly understood, distinct types of VGCCs appear to differentially affect synaptic properties. For example, P/Q-type VGCCs are located closer to release sites and are less affected by G-protein-mediated inhibition than are N-type VGCCs. Thus P/Q-type VGCCs might be beneficial at synapses with high probability of release and precise timing of neurotransmission, such as the inhibitory inputs from parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking (FS) interneurons to pyramidal cells (PCs) in the neocortex. To determine whether VGCCs types predominate at synapses from FS interneurons to PCs in rat prefrontal cortex, whole cell paired recordings (n = 14) combined with intracellular labeling and fluorescence immunohistochemistry for parvalbumin were performed in acute slices. Bath application of the specific N-type VGCC blocker omega-conotoxin-GVIa (1 microM) did not alter inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude, failure rate, or synaptic dynamics; in contrast, application of P/Q-type VGCC blocker omega-agatoxin-IVa (0.5 microM) completely and irreversibly blocked neurotransmission. These results indicate that P/Q-type VGCCs mediate the GABA release from parvalbumin-positive FS interneurons to PCs in the rat neocortex.},

  abstract    = {Although several findings indicate an association between adolescent cannabis abuse and the risk to develop schizophrenia later in life, the evidence for a causal relationship is still inconclusive. In the present study, we investigated the emergence of psychotic-like behavior in adult female rats chronically exposed to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during adolescence. To this aim, female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with THC during adolescence (PND 35-45) and, in adulthood (PND 75), a series of behavioral tests and biochemical assays were performed in order to investigate the long-term effects of adolescent THC exposure. Adolescent THC pretreatment leads to long-term behavioral alterations, characterized by recognition memory deficits, social withdrawal, altered emotional reactivity and sensitization to the locomotor activating effects of acute PCP. Moreover, since cortical disinhibition seems to be a key feature of many different animal models of schizophrenia and GABAergic hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been observed in postmortem brains from schizophrenic patients, we then investigated the long-lasting consequences of adolescent THC exposure on GABAergic transmission in the adult rat PFC. Biochemical analyses revealed that adolescent THC exposure results in reduced GAD67 and basal GABA levels within the adult PFC. GAD67 expression is reduced both in parvalbumin (PV)- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing interneurons; this alteration may be related to the altered emotional reactivity triggered by adolescent THC, as silencing PFC GAD67 expression through a siRNA-mediated approach is sufficient to impact rats' behavior in the forced swim test. Finally, the cellular underpinnings of the observed sensitized response to acute PCP in adult THC-treated rats could be ascribed to the increased cFos immunoreactivity and glutamate levels in the PFC and dorsal striatum. The present findings support the hypothesis that adolescent THC exposure may represent a risk factor for the development of a complex psychotic-like behavior in adulthood.},

  abstract    = {Clinical depression is a serious mental disorder characterized by low mood, anhedonia, loss of interest in daily activities, and other symptoms, and is associated with severe consequences including suicide and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Depression affects nearly 15\% of the population. The standard of care for the last 50 years has focused on monoamine neurotransmitters, including such treatments as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, these treatments have significant limitations: they can take weeks before showing mood-altering effects, and only one to two out of ten patients shows clinical effects beyond those associated with placebo. A major paradigm shift in research into the treatment of depression is underway, based on promising results with the glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Further research has demonstrated the significance of glutamatergic pathways in depression and the association of this system with the stress pathway and magnesium homeostasis. Treatment with NMDA receptor antagonists and magnesium have shown the ability to sprout new synaptic connections and reverse stress-induced neural changes, opening up promising new territory for the development of drugs to meet the unmet need in patients with clinical depression.},

  abstract    = {The brain creates a model of the world around us. We can use this representation to perceive and comprehend what we see at any given moment, but also to vividly re-experience scenes from our past and imagine future (or even fanciful) scenarios. Recent work has shown that these cognitive functions - perception, imagination and recall of scenes and events - all engage the anterior hippocampus. In this Opinion article, we capitalize on new findings from functional neuroimaging to propose a model that links high-level cognitive functions to specific structures within the anterior hippocampus.},

  abstract    = {The intrinsic properties of distinct types of neuron play important roles in cortical network dynamics. One crucial determinant of neuronal behaviour is the cell's response to rhythmic subthreshold input, characterised by the input impedance, which can be determined by measuring the amplitude and phase of the membrane potential response to sinusoidal currents as a function of input frequency. In this study, we determined the impedance profiles of anatomically identified neurons in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus (pyramidal cells as well as interneurons located in the stratum oriens, including OLM cells, fast-spiking perisomatic region-targeting interneurons and cells with axonal arbour in strata oriens and radiatum). The basic features of the impedance profiles, as well as the passive membrane characteristics and the properties of the sag in the voltage response to negative current steps, were cell-type specific. With the exception of fast-spiking interneurons, all cell types showed subthreshold resonance, albeit with distinct features. The HCN channel blocker ZD7288 (10 microM) eliminated the resonance and changed the shape of the impedance curves, indicating the involvement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I(h). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings uncovered differences in the voltage-dependent activation and kinetics of I(h) between different cell types. Biophysical modelling demonstrated that the cell-type specificity of the impedance profiles can be largely explained by the properties of I(h) in combination with the passive membrane characteristics. We conclude that differences in I(h) and passive membrane properties result in a cell-type-specific response to inputs at given frequencies, and may explain, at least in part, the differential involvement of distinct types of neuron in various network oscillations.},

  abstract    = {1. Voltage-activated K+ currents were recorded from visually identified inhibitory interneurones of the CA1 stratum oriens-alveus region in neonatal rat hippocampal slices using outside-out patch and whole-cell voltage clamp techniques. 2. Outward currents comprised both a transient and a sustained component when elicited from a holding potential of -90 mV. Tail current analysis of current reversal potentials showed that outward currents were carried by potassium ions. 3. The transient current, IA, was activated with a time to peak within 5 ms, inactivated with a time constant of approximately 15 ms at 0 mV and possessed half-activation at -14 mV. Half-inactivation of the transient current occurred at -71 mV. At -90 mV, the transient current recovered from inactivation with a time constant of 142 ms. 4. Activation of currents from a holding potential of -50 mV permitted isolation of the sustained current, IK. In Ca(2+)-free conditions the sustained current showed rapid activation, reaching about 80\% of its maximum within 1.5 ms, and showed little inactivation during 1 s depolarizing steps. The majority of sustained outward currents showed no voltage-dependent inactivation. In approximately 20\% of cells, a slow time-dependent inactivation of the sustained current was observed, suggesting the presence of a second type of sustained current in these cells. 5. A Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current comprised a significant portion of the total sustained current; this current was activated at voltages positive to -30 mV and showed no time-dependent inactivation over a 1 s depolarizing step. This current component was removed in Ca(2+)-free conditions or by iberiotoxin. 6. Low concentrations of 4-AP (50 microM) attenuated both the transient and sustained current components recorded in a Ca(2+)-free solution. Higher concentrations of 4-AP (< 10 mM) were without further effect on the sustained current but completely blocked the transient current with an IC50 of 1.8 mM. TEA blocked the sustained current with an IC50 of 7.9 mM without significantly reducing the transient current. Both current components were resistant to dendrotoxin (500 nM).},

  abstract    = {Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that single subanesthetic dose of ketamine exerts rapid, robust, and lasting antidepressant-like effects. Nevertheless, repeated subanesthetic doses of ketamine produce psychosis-like effects with dysfunction of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. We hypothesized that PV interneurons play an important role in the antidepressant-like actions of ketamine, and different changes in PV interneurons occur with the antidepressant-like and propsychotic-like effects of ketamine. To test this hypothesis, ketamine's antidepressant-like effects were evaluated by the forced swimming test. Ketamine-induced stereotyped behaviors and hyperactivity actions and the function of PV interneurons were also assessed. We demonstrated that an acute dose of 10 mg/kg ketamine induced significant antidepressant-like effects and reduced the levels of PV and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing enzyme GAD67 in the rat prefrontal cortex. Moreover, inhibition of ketamine-induced loss of PV by apocynin blocked these antidepressant-like effects. Repeated administration of 30 mg/kg ketamine elicited stereotyped behaviors and hyperactivity actions as well as a longer duration of PV and GAD67 loss, higher brain glutamate levels, and lower brain GABA levels than acute single dose of ketamine. Our results reveal that the loss of phenotype of PV interneurons in the prefrontal cortex contributes to the antidepressant-like actions and is also involved in the propsychotic-like behaviors following acute and repeated ketamine administration, which may be partially mediated by the disinhibition of glutamate signaling. The different degrees and durations of the actions on PV interneurons produced by the two regimens of ketamine may partly underline the behavioral variance between the antidepressant- and propsychotic-like effects.},

  abstract    = {It has been suggested that sensory mismatch induces motion sickness, but its neural mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this issue, theta waves in the hippocampal formation (HF) were studied during sensory mismatch by backward translocation in awake rats. A monopolar electrode was implanted into the dentate gyrus in the HF, from which local field potentials were recorded. The rats were placed on a treadmill affixed to a motion stage translocated along a figure 8-shaped track. The rats were trained to run forward on the treadmill at the same speed as that of forward translocation of the motion stage (a forward condition) before the experimental (recording) sessions. In the experimental sessions, the rats were initially tested in the forward condition, and then tested in a backward (mismatch) condition, in which the motion stage was turned around by 180 degrees before translocation. That is, the rats were moved backward by translocation of the stage although the rats ran forward on the treadmill. The theta (6-9 Hz) power was significantly increased in the backward condition compared with the forward condition. However, the theta power gradually decreased by repeated testing in the backward condition. Furthermore, backward translocation of the stage without locomotion did not increase theta power. These results suggest that the HF might function as a comparator to detect sensory mismatch, and that alteration in HF theta activity might induce motion sickness.},

  abstract    = {Somatostatin (SST), a growth hormone inhibitory peptide, is expressed in different parts of the brain and functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. In the central nervous system (CNS), SST inhibits Ca(2+) influx and regulates neuronal excitability in the hippocampus, the brain region which plays a major role in seizure, as well as cognitive and memory function. Much like SST, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1 receptor) is also widely distributed in the CNS, associated with memory function ad exerts inhibitory effects on seizure. It is unknown whether overlapping functional activities of SST and CB1 receptor are also associated with coexpression in the hippocampus. In the present study, we determined the colocalization between SST and CB1 receptor in adult rat brain hippocampus. In the CNS, the majority of SST positive interneurons coexpress neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Accordingly, colocalization studies were also performed to determine whether nNOS positive neurons display comparable colocalization with CB1 receptor. The findings suggested that SST and nNOS are expressed in most interneurons whereas CB1 receptor is present in both interneurons and projection neurons in hippocampal regions. The distinct neuronal populations either expressing CB1 receptor, SST and nNOS alone or colocalization were observed in a region specific manner. Taken together, the observations described here anticipate the possibility of crosstalk between somatostatin subtypes and CB1 receptor in regulation of physiological activities in the hippocampus.},

  abstract    = {Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC) is the main compound of the Cannabis Sativa responsible for most of the effects of the plant. Another major constituent is cannabidiol (CBD), formerly regarded to be devoid of pharmacological activity. However, laboratory rodents and human studies have shown that this cannabinoid is able to prevent psychotic-like symptoms induced by high doses of Δ(9)- THC. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that CBD has antipsychotic effects as observed using animal models and in healthy volunteers. Thus, this article provides a critical review of the research evaluating antipsychotic potential of this cannabinoid. CBD appears to have pharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antipsychotic drugs as seem using behavioral and neurochemical techniques in animal models. Additionally, CBD prevented human experimental psychosis and was effective in open case reports and clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia with a remarkable safety profile. Moreover, fMRI results strongly suggest that the antipsychotic effects of CBD in relation to the psychotomimetic effects of Δ(9)-THC involve the striatum and temporal cortex that have been traditionally associated with psychosis. Although the mechanisms of the antipsychotic properties are still not fully understood, we propose a hypothesis that could have a heuristic value to inspire new studies. These results support the idea that CBD may be a future therapeutic option in psychosis, in general and in schizophrenia, in particular.},

The main objective of this in human study was to assess the sedative properties of Org 28611, a potent water-soluble CB1 agonist. Single ascending doses were administered during a slow 25 min infusion and after a 1 min bolus administration to healthy male volunteers. In addition, the pharmacokinetics, amnestic properties, postural stability, electro-encephalography, behavioural and cardiovascular effects were studied. Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg was used as a positive control. The pharmacokinetic parameters were proportional to dose. No effects were observed after intravenous administration of doses up to Org 28611 1 microg/kg. Dose-related effects were observed at higher doses. Although subjects reported subjective sedation after administration of Org 28611 3-10 microg/kg, the observed sedation was considerably less than after midazolam. Org 28611 is, therefore, not suitable for providing sedation for outpatient surgical procedures and doses above the maximum tolerated dose of 3 microg/kg (either administered as a slow infusion or a bolus dose) can cause untoward psychotropic effects.},

  abstract    = {This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was designed to identify which pharmacodynamic parameters most accurately quantify the effects of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the predominantly psychoactive component of cannabis. In addition, we investigated the acceptability and usefulness of a novel mode of intrapulmonary THC administration using a Volcano vaporizer and pure THC instead of cannabis. Rising doses of THC (2, 4, 6 and 8 mg) or vehicle were administered with 90 minutes intervals to twelve healthy males using a Volcano vaporizer. Very low between-subject variability was observed in THC plasma concentrations, characterising the Volcano vaporizer as a suitable method for the administration of THC. Heart rate showed a sharp increase and rapid decline after each THC administration (8 mg: 19.4 bpm: 95\% CI 13.2, 25.5). By contrast, dose dependent effects of body sway (8 mg: 108.5\%: 95\% CI 72.2\%, 152.4\%) and different subjective parameters did not return to baseline between doses (Visual Analogue Scales of 'alertness' (8 mg: -33.6 mm: 95\% CI -41.6, -25.7), 'feeling high' (8 mg: 1.09 U: 95\% CI 0.85, 1.33), 'external perception' (8 mg: 0.62 U: 95\% CI 0.37, 0.86)). PK/PD-modeling of heart rate displayed a relatively short equilibration half-life of 7.68 min. CNS parameters showed equilibration half-lives ranging between 39.4 - 84.2 min. Some EEG-frequency bands, and pupil size showed small changes following the highest dose of THC. No changes were seen in saccadic eye movements, smooth pursuit and adaptive tracking performance. These results may be applicable in the development of novel cannabinoid agonists and antagonists, and in studies of the pharmacology and physiology of cannabinoid systems in humans.},

The asymmetry of the measure allows feedback evaluations.

Transfer entropy is also able to eliminate some effects of common history in spike trains and obtains results that are different from cross-correlation. The basic transfer entropy properties are illustrated with simulations. The information transfer through a network of 16 simultaneous multiunit recordings in cat's auditory cortex was examined for a large number of acoustic stimulus types. Application of the transfer entropy to a large database of multiple single-unit activity in cat's primary auditory cortex revealed that most windows of temporal integration found during spontaneous activity range between 2 and 15 ms. The normalized transfer entropy shows similarities and differences with the strength of cross-correlation; these form the basis for revisiting the neural assembly concept.},

  abstract    = {Conventional research methodologies and data analytic approaches in psychiatric research are unable to reliably infer causal relations without experimental designs, or to make inferences about the functional properties of the complex systems in which psychiatric disorders are embedded. This article describes a series of studies to validate a novel hybrid computational approach-the Complex Systems-Causal Network (CS-CN) method-designed to integrate causal discovery within a complex systems framework for psychiatric research. The CS-CN method was first applied to an existing dataset on psychopathology in 163 children hospitalized with injuries (validation study). Next, it was applied to a much larger dataset of traumatized children (replication study). Finally, the CS-CN method was applied in a controlled experiment using a 'gold standard' dataset for causal discovery and compared with other methods for accurately detecting causal variables (resimulation controlled experiment). The CS-CN method successfully detected a causal network of 111 variables and 167 bivariate relations in the initial validation study. This causal network had well-defined adaptive properties and a set of variables was found that disproportionally contributed to these properties. Modeling the removal of these variables resulted in significant loss of adaptive properties. The CS-CN method was successfully applied in the replication study and performed better than traditional statistical methods, and similarly to state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms in the causal detection experiment. The CS-CN method was validated, replicated, and yielded both novel and previously validated findings related to risk factors and potential treatments of psychiatric disorders. The novel approach yields both fine-grain (micro) and high-level (macro) insights and thus represents a promising approach for complex systems-oriented research in psychiatry.},

Here we report a multi-stage schizophrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent associations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2 and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic relevance to schizophrenia, and are consistent with leading pathophysiological hypotheses. Independent of genes expressed in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.},

Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.},

  abstract    = {In 2000 Baddeley proposed the existence of a new component of working memory, the episodic buffer, which should contribute to the on-line maintenance of integrated memory traces. The author assumed that this component should be critical for immediate recall of a short story that exceeds the capacity of the phonological store. Accordingly, patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) should suffer of a deficit of the episodic buffer when immediate recall of a short story is impossible. On the other hand, the episodic buffer should be somewhat preserved in such patients when some IR can occur (Baddeley and Wilson, 2002). We adopted this logic for a voxel-based morphometry study. We compared the distribution of grey-matter density of two such groups of AD patients with and of a group of age-matched controls. We found that both AD groups had a significant atrophy of the left mid-hippocampus; on the other hand, the anterior part of the hippocampus was significantly more atrophic in patients who were also impaired on the immediate prose recall task. Six out of ten patients with no immediate recall were spared at "central executive" tasks. Taken together our findings suggest that the left anterior hippocampus contributes to the episodic buffer of the revised working memory model. We also suggest that the episodic buffer is somewhat independent from the central executive component of working memory.},

  abstract    = {The episodic buffer component of working memory is assumed to play a central role in the binding of features into objects, a process that was initially assumed to depend upon executive resources. Here, we review a program of work in which we specifically tested this assumption by studying the effects of a range of attentionally demanding concurrent tasks on the capacity to encode and retain both individual features and bound objects. We found no differential effect of concurrent load, even when the process of binding was made more demanding by separating the shape and color features spatially, temporally or across visual and auditory modalities. Bound features were however more readily disrupted by subsequent stimuli, a process we studied using a suffix paradigm. This suggested a need to assume a feature-based attentional filter followed by an object based storage process. Our results are interpreted within a modified version of the multicomponent working memory model. We also discuss work examining the role of the hippocampus in visual feature binding.},

Here, we briefly review evidence regarding the pattern of deficits within three domains: context processing, working memory and episodic memory. We suggest that there may be a common mechanism driving deficits in these domains - an impairment in the ability to actively represent goal information in working memory to guide behavior, a function we refer to as proactive control. We suggest that such deficits in proactive control reflect impairments in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, its interactions with other brain regions, such as parietal cortex, thalamus and striatum, and the influence of neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine, GABA and glutamate.},

This article provides a brief overview of the current theories and data on the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in working memory, which is a summary of the presentation and discussion on working memory that occurred at the first Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) meeting (Washington, D.C.). At this meeting, the consensus was that the constructs of goal maintenance and interference control were the most ready to be pursued as part of a translational cognitive neuroscience effort at future CNTRICS meetings. The constructs of long-term memory reactivation, capacity, and strategic encoding were felt to be of great clinical interest but requiring more basic research. In addition, the group felt that the constructs of maintenance over time and updating in working memory had growing construct validity at the psychological and neural levels but required more research in schizophrenia before these should be considered as targets for a clinical trials setting.},

  abstract    = {Accumulating evidence suggests a role for the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in working memory (WM). However, little is known concerning its functional interactions with other cortical regions in the distributed neural network subserving WM. To reveal these, we availed of subjects with MTL damage and characterized changes in effective connectivity while subjects engaged in WM task. Specifically, we compared dynamic causal models, extracted from magnetoencephalographic recordings during verbal WM encoding, in temporal lobe epilepsy patients (with left hippocampal sclerosis) and controls. Bayesian model comparison indicated that the best model (across subjects) evidenced bilateral, forward, and backward connections, coupling inferior temporal cortex (ITC), inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and MTL. MTL damage weakened backward connections from left MTL to left ITC, a decrease accompanied by strengthening of (bidirectional) connections between IFC and MTL in the contralesional hemisphere. These findings provide novel evidence concerning functional interactions between nodes of this fundamental cognitive network and sheds light on how these interactions are modified as a result of focal damage to MTL. The findings highlight that a reduced (top-down) influence of the MTL on ipsilateral language regions is accompanied by enhanced reciprocal coupling in the undamaged hemisphere providing a first demonstration of "connectional diaschisis."},

  abstract    = {Cognitive impairment is a cause of significant disability in patients with schizophrenia. To date, no drug has been approved for this indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This article presents findings suggesting that a medication targeting the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) might meet this need. This single-center, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind,placebo-controlled study examined 21 medically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with second generation antipsychotics. Patients were treated with a daily dose of either 0.3 mg (n=8) or 1.0 mg (n=9) of EVP-6124, an α7 nAChR partial agonist, or placebo (n=4). Treatment continued for 21 days while patients continued their usual antipsychotic medication: aripiprazole (10-30 mg/day), olanzapine (10-20 mg/day), paliperidone (3-12 mg/day), or risperidone (2-16 mg/day). Cognitive test performance, eventrelated electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials, clinical symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical side effects were measured. EVP-6124 was well tolerated and showed positive, and in some cases, dose-dependent effects on several EEG responses, especially the Mismatch Negativity and P300 potentials. Positive effects were also found in performance on cognitive tests that measured non-verbal learning, memory, and executive function. This study is an example of the type of early proof of concept trial that is done to enable drug developers to evaluate whether to continue research on an agent. Based on the promising findings in this study, larger phase II studies were initiated to further test the pro-cognitive effects of EVP-6124 in patients with chronic schizophrenia.Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic Study of EVP-6124 in Patients with Schizophrenia, NCT01556763 http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01556763?term=NCT01556763&rank=1.},

  abstract    = {The studies of the neural correlates of verbal working memory in schizophrenia are somewhat inconsistent. This could be related to experimental paradigms that engage differentially working memory components or methodological limitations in terms of characterization of brain activity. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were obtained on 10 schizophrenia patients and 11 healthy controls while performing a modified Sternberg paradigm to investigate subprocesses of verbal working memory. A new method for temporospatial characterization of brain oscillations was applied to whole head recordings and a 1-48 Hz frequency range. Patients differed from controls in event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) patterns during the encode phase, the mid-maintain phase, and the end of the maintain phase. During the encode phase, patients did not show 1-4 Hz ERS in the left anterior frontal and left parietal lobes. In the mid-maintain phase, the left anterior frontal and left parietal lobes 1-4 Hz ERS, and the bilateral occipital lobes 8-32 Hz ERS were not observed in patients. At the end of the maintain phase, patients did not exhibit 12-48 Hz ERD in the left frontal and parietal lobes. The behavioral data showed reduced primacy effect In schizophrenia, the encode and maintain subprocesses were associated with less ERS and less ERD, respectively. These ERS/ERD abnormalities had specificity in terms of frequency and spatial location. Less ERD reflects reduced complexity of the neural activity, while reduced ERS reflects failure of the neural systems to resume idle state. The impaired primacy effect appears related to specific ERS/ERD patterns in the encode and maintain phases.},

  abstract    = {Abnormality of P300 waveforms of event-related potentials (ERPs) has been suggested to represent an aspect of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous work points to the contribution of altered neural function in discrete brain regions in the left hemisphere to psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. In this study, we sought to determine: 1) if patients with schizophrenia elicit a decreased P300 current source density in brain areas, such as the superior temporal gyrus (STG); 2) if decreased P300 generator density in the left STG is recovered by treatment with the most widely-used antipsychotic drug olanzapine; and 3) if the recovery of P300 source density is associated with improvements of cognitive and functional status. P300 in response to an auditory oddball task, as well as verbal learning memory, psychopathology, and quality of life were evaluated in 16 right-handed patients with schizophrenia before and after treatment with olanzapine for 6 months. ERP data were also obtained from 16 right-handed age and gender-matched normal volunteers. Low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis was used to obtain current density images of P300. Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly smaller LORETA values in several brain regions in the left side, particularly STG, middle frontal gyrus, and precentral gyrus, compared with control subjects. Six-month treatment with olanzapine significantly increased P300 source density only in the left STG. Positive symptoms, negative symptoms, verbal learning memory, and quality of life were also improved during treatment. Significant correlations were found between the increase in LORETA values of left STG vs. improvements of negative symptoms, as measured by Scale for the Assessment of the Negative Symptoms, and verbal learning memory, as measured by the Japanese Verbal Learning Test. Improvement of quality of life, as evaluated by the Quality of Life Scale, were significantly associated with an increase in LORETA values of middle frontal gyrus, and tended to correlate with that of precentral gyrus. The results of this study suggest that changes in cortical activity, as measured by ERPs, are responsible for the ability of some antipsychotic drugs to improve cognition and functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) exert major control over neuronal activity by activating cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). The functionality of the eCB system is primarily ascribed to the well-documented retrograde activation of presynaptic CB1Rs. We find that action potential-driven eCB release leads to a long-lasting membrane potential hyperpolarization in hippocampal principal cells that is independent of CB1Rs. The hyperpolarization, which is specific to CA3 and CA2 pyramidal cells (PCs), depends on the activation of neuronal CB2Rs, as shown by a combined pharmacogenetic and immunohistochemical approach. Upon activation, they modulate the activity of the sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter, leading to a hyperpolarization of the neuron. CB2R activation occurred in a purely self-regulatory manner, robustly altered the input/output function of CA3 PCs, and modulated gamma oscillations in vivo. To conclude, we describe a cell type-specific plasticity mechanism in the hippocampus that provides evidence for the neuronal expression of CB2Rs and emphasizes their importance in basic neuronal transmission.},

  abstract    = {In healthy humans, it has been shown that executive functions are associated with increased frontal-midline EEG theta activity and theta phase coupling between frontal and posterior brain regions. In individuals with schizophrenia, central executive functions are supposed to be heavily impaired. Given that theta phase coupling is causally involved in central executive functions, one would expect that patients with an executive function deficit should display abnormal EEG theta synchronization. We therefore investigated executive functioning in 21 healthy controls and 21 individuals with schizophrenia while they performed a visuospatial delayed match to sample task. The task required either high executive demands (manipulation of content in working memory [WM]) or low executive demands (retention of WM content). In addition, WM load (one vs. three items) was varied. Results indicated higher frontal theta activity for manipulation processes than for retention processes in patients with schizophrenia, as compared with healthy controls, independently of WM load. Furthermore, individuals with schizophrenia revealed a reduction in theta phase coupling during early stages of the delay period for retention, as well as for manipulation processes at high-WM loads. Deviations in theta phase coupling in individuals with schizophrenia were mainly characterized by aberrant fronto-posterior connections, but also by attenuated posterior connections during manipulation of high-WM load. To conclude, fronto-parietal theta coupling seems to be substantially involved in executive control, whereas frontal theta activity seems to reflect general task demands, such as deployment of attentional resources during WM.},

  abstract    = {While many drug discovery research programs aim to develop highly selective clinical candidates, their clinical success is limited because of the complex non-linear interactions of human brain neuronal circuits. Therefore, a rational approach for identifying appropriate synergistic multipharmacology and validating optimal target combinations is desperately needed. A mechanism-based Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) computer-based modeling platform that combines biophysically realistic preclinical neurophysiology and neuropharmacology with clinical information is a possible solution. This paper reports the application of such a model for Cognitive Impairment In Schizophrenia (CIAS), where the cholinomimetics galantamine and donepezil are combined with memantine and with different antipsychotics and smoking in a virtual human patient experiment. The results suggest that cholinomimetics added to antipsychotics have a modest effect on cognition in CIAS in non-smoking patients with haloperidol and risperidone and to a lesser extent with olanzapine and aripiprazole. Smoking reduces the effect of cholinomimetics with aripiprazole and olanzapine, but enhances the effect in haloperidol and risperidone. Adding memantine to antipsychotics improves cognition except with quetiapine, an effect enhanced with smoking. Combining cholinomimetics, antipsychotics and memantine in general shows an additive effect, except for a negative interaction with aripiprazole and quetiapine and a synergistic effect with olanzapine and haloperidol in non-smokers and haloperidol in smokers. The complex interaction of cholinomimetics with memantine, antipsychotics and smoking can be quantitatively studied using mechanism-based advanced computer modeling. QSP modeling of virtual human patients can possibly generate useful insights on the non-linear interactions of multipharmacology drugs and support complex CNS R&D projects in cognition in search of synergistic polypharmacy.},

The Matrics initiative lays out a regulatory path forward and a number of targets have been tested in the clinic, so far without much success. To address this translational disconnect, we have developed a mechanism-based humanized computer model of a relevant key cortical brain network with schizophrenia pathology involved with the maintenance aspect of working memory (WM). The model is calibrated using published clinical experiments on N-back WM tests. We further simulate the opposite effect of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators lorazepam and flumazenil and of a published augmentation trial of clozapine with risperidone, illustrating the introduction of new targets and the capacity of predicting the effects of polypharmacy. This humanized approach allows for early prospective and quantitative assessment of cognitive outcome in a central nervous system (CNS) research and development project, thereby hopefully increasing the success rate of clinical trials.CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology (2013) 2, e36; doi:10.1038/psp.2013.12; advance online publication 3 April 2013.},

  abstract    = {Methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin©) is widely used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and recently as a drug of abuse. Although the effect of MPH has been studied in brain regions such as striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus has received relatively little attention. It is known that MPH increases the TBS-dependent Long Term Potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still unknown. Using field potential recordings and western blot analysis in rat hippocampal slices of young rats, we found that acute application of MPH enhances LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 73.44±6.32 nM. Using specific antagonists and paired-pulse facilitation protocols, we observed that the MPH-dependent increase of LTP involves not only β-adrenergic receptors activation but also post-synaptic D1/D5 dopamine receptors. The inhibition of PKA with PKI, suppressed the facilitation of LTP induced by MPH consistent with an involvement of the adenyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA dependent cascade downstream of the activation of D1/D5 receptors. In addition, samples of CA1 areas taken from slices potentiated with MPH presented an increase in the phosphorylation of the Ser845 residue of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors compared to control slices. This effect was reverted by SCH23390, antagonist of D1/D5 receptors, and PKI. Moreover, we found an increase of surface-associated functional AMPA receptors. We propose that MPH increases TBS-dependent LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses through a polysynaptic mechanism involving activation of β-adrenergic and D1/D5 dopaminergic receptors and promoting the trafficking and insertion of functional AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane.},

The methylphenidate group and model group were respectively administered the drug (10mg/kg, i.p.) and saline 30 min before place navigation on 6 consecutive days, a control group of Wistar Kyoto rats were administered saline in the same way. Transmission electron microscopic and imaging analyses were then used to detect and analyze any microstructural changes. The performance of the model rats treated with the drug was the best in the probe test. In addition, three parameters including the length of the active zone, the thickness of the postsynaptic density and the synaptic curvature were measured to show the significant synaptic configuration changes in the methylphenidate group in comparison to the model group. Therefore, these ultrastructural changes in the hippocampal CA3 region may be one of the mechanisms by which methylphenidate improves the spatial memory ability of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The Wistar Kyoto rats showed a significantly decreased latency for finding the platform from the second day in spite of a floating characteristic, while in the probe test, their performance was close to that of the model rats. Finally, morphological evidence suggested the model rats to have a cognitive impairment in comparison to the control group and their better performance was possibly due to the physiological hyper-response of WKY in the water maze tasks.},

  abstract    = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioural disorder among children. ADHD children are hyperactive, impulsive and have problems with sustained attention. These cardinal features are also present in the best validated animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), which is derived from the Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY). Current theories of ADHD relate symptom development to factors that alter learning. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dependent long term changes in synaptic efficacy in the mammalian CNS are thought to represent underlying cellular mechanisms for some forms of learning. We therefore hypothesized that synaptic abnormality in excitatory, glutamatergic synaptic transmission might contribute to the altered behavior in SHRs. We studied physiological and anatomical aspects of hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses in age-matched SHR and WKY (controls). Electrophysiological analysis of these synapses showed reduced synaptic transmission (reduced field excitatory postsynaptic potential for a defined fiber volley size) in SHR, whereas short-term forms of synaptic plasticity, like paired-pulse facilitation, frequency facilitation, and delayed response enhancement were comparable in the two genotypes, and long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission was of similar magnitude. However, LTP in SHR was significantly reduced (by 50\%) by the NR2B specific blocker CP-101,606 (10 microM), whereas the blocker had no effect on LTP magnitude in the control rats. This indicates that the SHR has a functional predominance of NR2B, a feature characteristic of early developmental stages in these synapses. Quantitative immunofluorescence and electron microscopic postembedding immunogold cytochemistry of the three major NMDAR subunits (NR1, NR2A; and NR2B) in stratum radiatum spine synapses revealed no differences between SHR and WKY. The results indicate that functional impairments in glutamatergic synaptic transmission may be one of the underlying mechanisms leading to the abnormal behavior in SHR, and possibly in human ADHD.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that relational memory is particularly impaired.To study the neural correlates of relational memory in schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging.Cross-sectional case-control study.Academic medical center. Subjects Twenty patients with schizophrenia and 17 control subjects.Behavioral performance and brain activity were assessed during the discrimination of previously seen and novel pairs of visual stimuli, which varied in the degree of relational memory load. We performed whole-brain and region-of-interest (hippocampus) analyses.Schizophrenic subjects displayed normal activation of the presupplementary motor area and ventral prefrontal cortex, but significantly decreased recruitment of the right parietal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex when discriminating novel pairs derived from a sequence of stimuli. Discrimination accuracy was decreased in schizophrenia only when the flexible representation of a sequence was required. This selective deficit was associated with decreased activation of the right parietal cortex and left hippocampus.Schizophrenia is characterized by a specific deficit of relational memory, which is associated with impaired function of the parietal cortex and hippocampus. Abnormal relational memory may be at the core of 2 prominent features of schizophrenia, ie, cognitive deficits and psychosis.},

  abstract    = {The most typical and well known inhibitory action in the cortical microcircuit is a strong inhibition on the target neuron by axo-somatic synapses. However, it has become clear that synaptic inhibition in the cortex is much more diverse and complicated. Firstly, at least ten or more inhibitory non-pyramidal cell subtypes engage in diverse inhibitory functions to produce the elaborate activity characteristic of the different cortical states. Each distinct non-pyramidal cell subtype has its own independent inhibitory function. Secondly, the inhibitory synapses innervate different neuronal domains, such as axons, spines, dendrites and soma, and their inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) size is not uniform. Thus, cortical inhibition is highly complex, with a wide variety of anatomical and physiological modes. Moreover, the functional significance of the various inhibitory synapse innervation styles and their unique structural dynamic behaviors differ from those of excitatory synapses. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the inhibitory mechanisms of the cortical microcircuit.},

Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Preclinical studies indicate that some ketamine effects may be mediated through increased glutamate release. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lamotrigine, a drug reported to inhibit glutamate release, will reduce the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine in humans.Healthy subjects (n = 16) completed 4 test days involving the administration of lamotrigine, 300 mg by mouth, or placebo 2 hours prior to administration of ketamine (0.26 mg/kg by intravenous bolus and 0.65 mg/kg per hour by intravenous infusion) or placebo in a randomized order under double-blind conditions. Behavioral and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and after administration of the medications.Lamotrigine significantly decreased ketamine-induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (P<.001); positive symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptoms subscale (P<.001); negative symptoms as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptoms subscale (P<.05); and learning and memory impairment as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (P<.05). However, lamotrigine increased the immediate mood-elevating effects of ketamine (P<.05).Glutamate release-inhibiting drugs may reduce the hyperglutamatergic consequences of NMDA receptor dysfunction implicated in the pathophysiologic processes of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.

We used large-scale recordings to examine the activity of neurons in the frontal cortex of rats and first observed that the distribution of pyramidal cell firing rates was wide and strongly skewed toward high firing rates. Moreover, neurons from different parts of that distribution were differentially modulated by sleep substates. Periods of nonREM sleep reduced the activity of high firing rate neurons and tended to upregulate firing of slow-firing neurons. By contrast, the effect of REM was to reduce firing rates across the entire rate spectrum. Microarousals, interspersed within nonREM epochs, increased firing rates of slow-firing neurons. The net result of sleep was to homogenize the firing rate distribution. These findings are at variance with current homeostatic models and provide a novel view of sleep in adjusting network excitability.},

  abstract    = {Recent findings indicate that the hippocampus supports not only long-term memory encoding but also plays a role in working memory (WM) maintenance of multiple items; however, the neural mechanism underlying multi-item maintenance is still unclear. Theoretical work suggests that multiple items are being maintained by neural assemblies synchronized in the gamma frequency range (25-100 Hz) that are locked to consecutive phase ranges of oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz). Indeed, cross-frequency coupling of the amplitude of high-frequency activity to the phase of slower oscillations has been described both in animals and in humans, but has never been linked to a theoretical model of a cognitive process. Here we used intracranial EEG recordings in human epilepsy patients to test pivotal predictions from theoretical work. First, we show that simultaneous maintenance of multiple items in WM is accompanied by cross-frequency coupling of oscillatory activity in the hippocampus, which is recruited during multi-item WM. Second, maintenance of an increasing number of items is associated with modulation of beta/gamma amplitude with theta band activity of lower frequency, consistent with the idea that longer cycles are required for an increased number of representations by gamma cycles. This effect cannot be explained by a difference in theta or beta/gamma power. Third, we describe how the precision of cross-frequency coupling predicts individual WM performance. These data support the idea that working memory in humans depends on a neural code using phase information.},

  abstract    = {The Memory NEo-Structural Inter-Systemic model (MNESIS; Eustache and Desgranges, Neuropsychology Review, 2008) is a macromodel based on neuropsychological data which presents an interactive construction of memory systems and processes. Largely inspired by Tulving's SPI model, MNESIS puts the emphasis on the existence of different memory systems in humans and their reciprocal relations, adding new aspects, such as the episodic buffer proposed by Baddeley. The more integrative comprehension of brain dynamics offered by neuroimaging has contributed to rethinking the existence of memory systems. In the present article, we will argue that understanding the concept of memory by dividing it into systems at the functional level is still valid, but needs to be considered in the light of brain imaging. Here, we reinstate the importance of this division in different memory systems and illustrate, with neuroimaging findings, the links that operate between memory systems in response to task demands that constrain the brain dynamics. During a cognitive task, these memory systems interact transiently to rapidly assemble representations and mobilize functions to propose a flexible and adaptative response. We will concentrate on two memory systems, episodic and semantic memory, and their links with autobiographical memory. More precisely, we will focus on interactions between episodic and semantic memory systems in support of 1) self-identity in healthy aging and in brain pathologies and 2) the concept of the prospective brain during future projection. In conclusion, this MNESIS global framework may help to get a general representation of human memory and its brain implementation with its specific components which are in constant interaction during cognitive processes.},

We then move on to discuss the results of 20 years of investigation of those ideas. First, evidence is described from animal studies consistent with the ideas that memory for different kinds of information is stored in different brain systems, and that the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal striatum are each central structures in one of the systems. We then focus on the 3 tasks used in the original triple dissociation: win-stay learning, conditioned cue preference, and win-shift learning. Each of these tasks is specific to behavior resulting from the type of information stored in one of the systems, but the use of other behavioral tests that are sensitive to the types of information stored in other systems has revealed that, in each case, other types of information are acquired in parallel. Next, evidence consistent with the idea that the outputs of the systems compete for control of behavior is discussed together with alternative forms of more direct interactions among the systems. Finally, some evidence that many of these ideas about multiple parallel memory systems may apply to humans is reviewed.},

  abstract    = {Most lesion studies in animals, and neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging studies in humans, have focused on finding dissociations between the functions of different brain regions, for example in relation to different types of memory. While some of these dissociations can be questioned, particularly in the case of neuroimaging data, we start by assuming a "modal model" in which at least three different memory systems are distinguished: an episodic system (which stores associations between items and spatial/temporal contexts, and which is supported primarily by the hippocampus); a semantic system (which extracts combinations of perceptual features that define items, and which is supported primarily by anterior temporal cortex); and modality-specific perceptual systems (which represent the sensory features extracted from a stimulus, and which are supported by higher sensory cortices). In most situations however, behavior is determined by interactions between these systems. These interactions reflect the flow of information in both "forward" and "backward" directions between memory systems, where backward connections transmit predictions about the current item/features based on the current context/item. Importantly, it is the resulting "prediction error"--the difference between these predictions and the forward transmission of sensory evidence--that drives memory encoding and retrieval. We describe how this "predictive interactive multiple memory systems" (PIMMS) framework can be applied to human neuroimaging data acquired during encoding or retrieval phases of the recognition memory paradigm. Our novel emphasis is thus on associations rather than dissociations between activity measured in key brain regions; in particular, we propose that measuring the functional coupling between brain regions will help understand how these memory systems interact to guide behavior.},

  abstract    = {Neurobehavioral evidence supports the existence of at least two anatomically distinct "memory systems" in the mammalian brain that mediate dissociable types of learning and memory; a "cognitive" memory system dependent upon the hippocampus and a "stimulus-response/habit" memory system dependent upon the dorsolateral striatum. Several findings indicate that despite their anatomical and functional distinctiveness, hippocampal- and dorsolateral striatal-dependent memory systems may potentially interact and that, depending on the learning situation, this interaction may be cooperative or competitive. One approach to examining the neural mechanisms underlying these interactions is to consider how various factors influence the relative use of multiple memory systems. The present review examines several such factors, including information compatibility, temporal sequence of training, the visual sensory environment, reinforcement parameters, emotional arousal, and memory modulatory systems. Altering these parameters can lead to selective enhancements of either hippocampal-dependent or dorsolateral striatal-dependent memory, and bias animals toward the use of either cognitive or habit memory in dual-solution tasks that may be solved adequately with either memory system. In many learning situations, the influence of such experimental factors on the relative use of memory systems likely reflects a competitive interaction between the systems. Research examining how various factors influence the relative use of multiple memory systems may be a useful method for investigating how these systems interact with one another.},

Beginning about 1980, evidence from normal subjects, amnesic patients, and experimental animals converged on the view that a fundamental distinction could be drawn between a kind of memory that is accessible to conscious recollection and another kind that is not. Subsequent work shifted thinking beyond dichotomies to a view, grounded in biology, that memory is composed of multiple separate systems supported, for example, by the hippocampus and related structures, the amygdala, the neostriatum, and the cerebellum. This article traces the development of these ideas and provides a current perspective on how these brain systems operate to support behavior.},

  abstract    = {The medial temporal lobe is indispensable for normal memory processing in both human and non-human primates, as is shown by the fact that large lesions in it produce a severe impairment in the acquisition of new memories. The widely accepted inference from this observation is that the medial temporal cortex, including the hippocampal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, contains a memory system or multiple memory systems, which are specialized for the acquisition and storage of memories. Nevertheless, there are some strong arguments against this idea: medial temporal lesions produce amnesia by disconnecting the entire temporal cortex from neuromodulatory afferents arising in the brainstem and basal forebrain, not by removing cortex; the temporal cortex is essential for perception as well as for memory; and response properties of temporal cortical neurons make it impossible that some kinds of memory trace could be stored in the temporal lobe. All cortex is plastic, and it is possible that the same rules of plasticity apply to all cortical areas; therefore, memory traces are stored in widespread cortical areas rather than in a specialized memory system restricted to the temporal lobe. Among these areas, the prefrontal cortex has an important role in learning and memory, but is best understood as an area with no specialization of function.},

  abstract    = {Visual working memory (VWM) is used to maintain sensory information for cognitive operations, and its deficits are associated with several neuropsychological disorders. VWM is based on sustained neuronal activity in a complex cortical network of frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal areas. The neuronal mechanisms that coordinate this distributed processing to sustain coherent mental images and the mechanisms that set the behavioral capacity limit have remained unknown. We mapped the anatomical and dynamic structures of network synchrony supporting VWM by using a neuro informatics approach and combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Interareal phase synchrony was sustained and stable during the VWM retention period among frontoparietal and visual areas in alpha- (10-13 Hz), beta- (18-24 Hz), and gamma- (30-40 Hz) frequency bands. Furthermore, synchrony was strengthened with increasing memory load among the frontoparietal regions known to underlie executive and attentional functions during memory maintenance. On the other hand, the subjects' individual behavioral VWM capacity was predicted by synchrony in a network in which the intraparietal sulcus was the most central hub. These data suggest that interareal phase synchrony in the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency bands among frontoparietal and visual regions could be a systems level mechanism for coordinating and regulating the maintenance of neuronal object representations in VWM.},

  abstract    = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides executive control of the brain in humans and rodents, coordinating cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to threatening stimuli and subsequent feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The endocannabinoid system has emerged as a fundamental regulator of HPA axis feedback inhibition and an important modulator of emotional behavior. However, the precise role of endocannabinoid signaling within the PFC with respect to stress coping and emotionality has only recently been investigated. This review discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the localization and function of the endocannabinoid system in the PFC, its sensitivity to stress and its role in modulating the neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. We propose a model whereby steady-state endocannabinoid signaling in the medial PFC indirectly regulates the outflow of pyramidal neurons by fine-tuning GABAergic inhibition. Local activation of this population of CB1 receptors increases the downstream targets of medial PFC activation, which include inhibitory interneurons in the basolateral amygdala, inhibitory relay neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and monoamine cell bodies such as the dorsal raphe nucleus. This ultimately produces beneficial effects on emotionality (active coping responses to stress and reduced anxiety) and assists in constraining activation of the HPA axis. Under conditions of chronic stress, or in individuals suffering from mood disorders, this system may be uniquely recruited to help maintain appropriate function in the face of adversity, while breakdown of the endocannabinoid system in the medial PFC may be, in and of itself, sufficient to produce neuropsychiatric illness. Thus, we suggest that endocannabinoid signaling in the medial PFC may represent an attractive target for the treatment of stress-related disorders.},

CB(1)R activation by the synthetic agonists, WIN55212-2 (1 μM) and R-methanandamide (1 μM) inhibited the simultaneously measured evoked Ca(2+)-dependent release of [(14)C]glutamate and [(3)H]serotonin from frontocortical nerve terminals of Wistar rats, in a fashion sensitive to the CB(1)R antagonists, O-2050 (1 μM) and LY320135 (5 μM). CB(1)R agonists also inhibited the evoked release of [(14)C]glutamate in C57BL/6J mice in a reversible fashion upon washout. Interestingly, the evoked release of [(14)C]glutamate and [(3)H]serotonin was significantly greater in the CB(1)R knockout CD-1 mice. Furthermore, CB(1)R binding experiments revealed similar frontocortical CB(1)R density in the rat and the CD-1 mouse. Still, the evoked release of [(3)H]serotonin was modulated by neither CB(1)R agonists nor antagonists in wild-type CD-1 or C57BL/6J mice. Altogether, this is the first study to demonstrate functional presynaptic CB(1)Rs in frontocortical glutamatergic and serotonergic terminals, revealing species differences.},

Here we examined the dynamics of thalamocortical communication during long-term episodic memory retrieval in two experiments. In experiment 1, intrathalamic and surface EEG was recorded in an epileptic patient implanted with depth electrodes for brain stimulation therapy. In a recognition memory test, early (300-500 ms) stimulus-linked oscillatory synchrony between mediodorsal thalamic and frontal surface electrodes at beta frequency (20 Hz) was enhanced for correctly remembered old compared to correctly rejected new items. Directionality measures (Granger causality) indicated that the thalamus was the sender, and the neocortex the receiver, of this beta signal, which also modulated the power of neocortical gamma (55-80 Hz) oscillations (cross-frequency coupling). Experiment 2 validated the cross-frequency coupling effects in a healthy participant sample. Confirming the findings from experiment 1, significantly increased cross-frequency coupling was found over frontal scalp electrodes during successful recognition. Extending anatomical knowledge on thalamic connectivity with frontal neocortex, these results suggest that the thalamus sends an early memory signal to frontal regions, triggering further memory search processes.},

  abstract    = {Functional networks are comprised of neuronal ensembles bound through synchronization across multiple intrinsic oscillatory frequencies. Various coupled interactions between brain oscillators have been described (e.g., phase-amplitude coupling), but with little evidence that these interactions actually influence perceptual sensitivity. Here, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were made during a sustained-attention task to demonstrate that cross-frequency coupling has significant consequences for perceptual outcomes (i.e., whether participants detect a near-threshold visual target). The data reveal that phase-detection relationships at higher frequencies are dependent on the phase of lower frequencies, such that higher frequencies alternate between periods when their phase is either strongly or weakly predictive of visual-target detection. Moreover, the specific higher frequencies and scalp topographies linked to visual-target detection also alternate as a function of lower-frequency phase. Cross-frequency coupling between lower (i.e., delta and theta) and higher frequencies (e.g., low- and high-beta) thus results in dramatic fluctuations of visual-target detection.},

  abstract    = {Despite decades of research, the neural mechanism of central executive and working memory is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new neural network model for the real-time control of working memory. The key idea is to consider separately the role of neural activation from that of oscillatory phase. Neural populations encoding different information would not confuse each other when the populations have different oscillatory phases. Depending on the current situation, relevant memories bind together through phase-locking between theta-frequency oscillation of a Central Unit and alpha-frequency oscillations of the relevant group of Memory Units. The Central Unit dynamically controls which Memory Units should be synchronized (and the encoded memory would be processed), and which units should be out of phase (the encoded memory is standby and would not be processed yet). Simulations of two working memory tasks are provided as examples. The model is in agreement with many recent experimental results of human scalp EEG analysis, which reported observations of neural synchronization and cross-frequency coupling during working memory tasks. This model offers a possible explanation of the underlying mechanism for these experiments.},

  abstract    = {α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) positive allosteric modulation (i.e., "potentiation") has been proposed to overcome cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, but AMPAR overstimulation can be excitotoxic. Thus, it is critical to define carefully a potentiator's mechanism-based therapeutic index (TI) and to determine confidently its translatability from rodents to higher-order species. Accordingly, the novel AMPAR potentiator N-{(3R,4S)-3-[4-(5-cyano-2-thienyl)phenyl]tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl}propane-2-sulfonamide (PF-4778574) was characterized in a series of in vitro assays and single-dose animal studies evaluating AMPAR-mediated activities related to cognition and safety to afford an unbound brain compound concentration (Cb,u)-normalized interspecies exposure-response relationship. Because it is unknown which AMPAR subtype(s) may be selectively potentiated for an optimal TI, PF-4778574 binding affinity and functional potency were determined in rodent tissues expected to express a native mixture of AMPAR subunits and their associated proteins to afford composite pharmacological values. Functional activity was also quantified in recombinant cell lines stably expressing human GluA2 flip or flop homotetramers. Procognitive effects of PF-4778574 were evaluated in both rat electrophysiological and nonhuman primate (nhp) behavioral models of pharmacologically induced N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor hypofunction. Safety studies assessed cerebellum-based AMPAR activation (mouse) and motor coordination disruptions (mouse, dog, and nhp), as well as convulsion (mouse, rat, and dog). The resulting empirically derived exposure-response continuum for PF-4778574 defines a single-dose-based TI of 8- to 16-fold for self-limiting tremor, a readily monitorable clinical adverse event. Importantly, the Cb,u mediating each physiological effect were highly consistent across species, with efficacy and convulsion occurring at just fractions of the in vitro-derived pharmacological values.},

Frontal brain regions supporting WM maintenance operations undergo anatomical and functional changes with advancing age, leading to age related decline of memory functions. The present study focused on age-related functional connectivity changes of the frontal midline (FM) cortex in the theta band (4-8 Hz), related to WM maintenance. In the visual delayed-match-to-sample WM task young (18-26 years, N=20) and elderly (60-71 years N=16) adults had to memorize sample stimuli consisting of 3 or 5 items while 33 channel EEG recording was performed. The phase lag index was used to quantify connectivity strength between cortical regions. The low and high memory demanding WM maintenance periods were classified based on whether they were successfully maintained (remembered) or unsuccessfully maintained (unrecognized later). In the elderly reduced connectivity strength of FM brain region and decreased performance were observed. The connectivity strength between FM and posterior sensory cortices was shown to be sensitive to both increased memory demands and memory performance regardless of age. The coupling of frontal regions (midline and lateral) and FM-temporal cortices characterized successfully maintained trials and declined with advancing age. The findings provide evidence that a FM neural circuit of theta oscillations that serves a possible basis of active maintenance process is especially vulnerable to aging.},

One possible role of oscillatory activity is to assure the maintenance of information in working memory (WM). Here we review the possibility that rhythmic activity at theta, alpha, and gamma frequencies serve distinct functional roles during WM maintenance. Specifically, we propose that gamma-band oscillations are generically involved in the maintenance of WM information. By contrast, alpha-band activity reflects the active inhibition of task-irrelevant information, whereas theta-band oscillations underlie the organization of sequentially ordered WM items. Finally, we address the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in enabling alpha-gamma and theta-gamma codes for distinct WM information.},

  abstract    = {It has been proposed that working memory (WM) is updated/manipulated via a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit. One way that this could happen is via the synchronization of neural oscillations. A first step toward testing this hypothesis is to clearly establish a frontal scalp EEG signature of WM manipulation. Although many EEG studies have indeed revealed frontal EEG signatures for WM, especially in the theta frequency band (3-8 Hz), few of them required subjects to manipulate WM, and of those that did, none specifically tied the EEG signature to the manipulation process per se. Here we employed a WM manipulation task that has been shown with imaging to engage the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. We adapted this task to titrate the success of WM manipulation to approximately 50 \%. Using time-frequency analysis of EEG, we showed that theta power increased over frontal cortex for successful versus failed WM manipulation, specifically at the time of the manipulation event. This establishes a clear-cut EEG signature of WM manipulation. Future studies could employ this to test the fronto-basal-ganglia hypothesis of WM updating/manipulation.},

  abstract    = {Working memory (WM) processes help keep information in an active state so it can be used to guide future behavior. Although numerous studies have investigated brain activity associated with spatial WM in humans and monkeys, little research has focused on the neural mechanisms of WM for temporal order information, and how processing of temporal and spatial information might differ. Available evidence indicates that similar frontoparietal regions are recruited during temporal and spatial WM, although there are data suggesting that they are distinct processes. The mechanisms that allow for differential maintenance of these two types of information are unclear. One possibility is that neural oscillations may differentially contribute to temporal and spatial WM. In the present study, we used scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to compare patterns of oscillatory activity during maintenance of spatial and temporal information in WM. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed enhanced left frontal theta (5-8 Hz), enhanced posterior alpha (9-12 Hz), and enhanced left posterior beta (14-28 Hz) power during the delay period of correct temporal order trials compared to correct spatial trials. In contrast, gamma (30-50 Hz) power at right lateral frontal sites was increased during the delay period of spatial WM trials, as compared to temporal WM trials. The present results are consistent with the idea that neural oscillatory patterns provide distinct mechanisms for the maintenance of temporal and spatial information in WM. Specifically, theta oscillations are most critical for the maintenance of temporal information in WM. Possible roles of higher frequency oscillations in temporal and spatial memory are also discussed.},

  abstract    = {The concept of the "mnemonic scotoma," a spatially circumscribed region of working memory impairment produced by unilateral lesions of the PFC, is central to the view that PFC is critical for the short-term retention of information. Presented here, however, are previously unpublished data that offer an alternative, nonmnemonic interpretation of this pattern of deficit. In their study, Wajima and Sawaguchi [Wajima, K., & Sawaguchi, T. The role of GABAergic inhibiton in suppressing perseverative responses in the monkey prefrontal cortex. Neuroscience Research, 50(Suppl. 1), P3-P317, 2004] applied the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline methiodide unilaterally to the PFC of two monkeys while they performed an oculomotor delayed-response task. Consistent with previous studies, errors for the initial memory-guided saccade were markedly higher when the cued location fell into the region of the visual field affected by the infusion. These erroneous saccades tended to select an alternative target location (out of a possible 16) that had not been cued on that trial. By extending the analysis window, however, it was observed that the second, "corrective" saccade often acquired the location that had been cued on that trial. Further analysis of the erroneous initial saccades indicated that they tended to be directed to a location that had been relevant on the previous trial. Thus, the deficit was not one of "forgetting" the cued location. Rather, it was one of selecting between currently and previously relevant locations. These findings suggest a need for a reconsideration of the concept of the mnemonic scotoma, which in turn invites a reconsideration of functional interpretations of sustained neuronal activity in PFC.},

  abstract    = {Resilience, a system's ability to adjust its activity to retain its basic functionality when errors, failures and environmental changes occur, is a defining property of many complex systems. Despite widespread consequences for human health, the economy and the environment, events leading to loss of resilience--from cascading failures in technological systems to mass extinctions in ecological networks--are rarely predictable and are often irreversible. These limitations are rooted in a theoretical gap: the current analytical framework of resilience is designed to treat low-dimensional models with a few interacting components, and is unsuitable for multi-dimensional systems consisting of a large number of components that interact through a complex network. Here we bridge this theoretical gap by developing a set of analytical tools with which to identify the natural control and state parameters of a multi-dimensional complex system, helping us derive effective one-dimensional dynamics that accurately predict the system's resilience. The proposed analytical framework allows us systematically to separate the roles of the system's dynamics and topology, collapsing the behaviour of different networks onto a single universal resilience function. The analytical results unveil the network characteristics that can enhance or diminish resilience, offering ways to prevent the collapse of ecological, biological or economic systems, and guiding the design of technological systems resilient to both internal failures and environmental changes.},

More than 80\% of the patients had panic attacks, fibromyalgia, and major depressive episodes. Associations were found between joint laxity and bipolar III, headache with bipolar II, and bipolar II with chronic fatigue syndrome. Significant relationships were demonstrated within and between domains, validating ALPIM as a syndrome.},

  abstract    = {First-line treatment of major depression includes administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), yet studies suggest that remission rates following two trials of an SSRI are <50\%. The authors examine the putative biological substrates underlying "treatment resistant depression (TRD)" with the goal of elucidating novel rationales to treat TRD. We look at relevant articles from the preclinical and clinical literature combined with clinical exposure to TRD patients. A major focus was to outline pathophysiological mechanisms whereby the serotonin system becomes impervious to the desired enhancement of serotonin neurotransmission by SSRIs. A complementary focus was to dissect neurotransmitter systems, which serve to inhibit the dorsal raphe. We propose, based on a body of translational studies, TRD may not represent a simple serotonin deficit state but rather an excess of midbrain peri-raphe serotonin and subsequent deficit at key fronto-limbic projection sites, with ultimate compromise in serotonin-mediated neuroplasticity. Glutamate, serotonin, noradrenaline, and histamine are activated by stress and exert an inhibitory effect on serotonin outflow, in part by "flooding" 5-HT1A autoreceptors by serotonin itself. Certain factors putatively exacerbate this scenario - presence of the short arm of the serotonin transporter gene, early-life adversity and comorbid bipolar disorder - each of which has been associated with SSRI-treatment resistance. By utilizing an incremental approach, we provide a system for treating the TRD patient based on a strategy of rescuing serotonin neurotransmission from a state of SSRI-induced dorsal raphe stasis. This calls for "stacked" interventions, with an SSRI base, targeting, if necessary, the glutamatergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and histaminergic systems, thereby successively eliminating the inhibitory effects each are capable of exerting on serotonin neurons. Future studies are recommended to test this biologically based approach for treatment of TRD.},

  abstract    = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders which begin in childhood and persist into adulthood. They cause lifelong impairments and are associated with substantial burdens to patients, families, and society. Genetic studies have implicated the sodium/proton exchanger (NHE) nine gene, Slc9a9, to ASDs and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD). Slc9a9 encodes, NHE9, a membrane protein of the late recycling endosomes. The recycling endosome plays an important role in synapse development and plasticity by regulating the trafficking of membrane neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. Here we tested the hypothesis that Slc9a9 knock-out (KO) mice would show ADHD-like and ASD-like traits. Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) recording showed that Slc9a9 KO mice emitted fewer calls and had shorter call durations, which suggest communication impairment. Slc9a9 KO mice lacked a preference for social novelty, but did not show deficits in social approach; Slc9a9 KO mice spent more time self-grooming, an indicator for restricted and repetitive behavior. We did not observe hyperactivity or other behavior impairments which are commonly comorbid with ASDs in human, such as anxiety-like behavior. Our study is the first animal behavior study that links Slc9a9 to ASDs. By eliminatingNHE9 activity, it provides strong evidence that lack of Slc9a9leads to ASD-like behaviors in mice and provides the field with a new mouse model of ASDs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract    = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric condition, but it has been difficult to identify genes underlying this disorder. This study aimed to explore genetics of ADHD in an ethnically homogeneous Norwegian population by means of a genome-wide association (GWA) analysis followed by examination of candidate loci.Participants were recruited through Norwegian medical and birth registries as well as the general population. Presence of ADHD was defined according to DSM-IV criteria. Genotyping was performed using Illumina Human OmniExpress-12v1 microarrays. Statistical analyses were divided into several steps: (1) genome-wide association in the form of logistic regression in PLINK and follow-up pathway analyses performed in DAPPLE and INRICH softwares, (2) SNP-heritability calculated using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA) tool, (3) gene-based association tests carried out in JAG software, and (4) evaluation of previously reported genome-wide signals and candidate genes of ADHD.In total, 1.358 individuals (478 cases and 880 controls) and 598.384 autosomal SNPs were subjected to GWA analysis. No single polymorphism reached genome-wide significance. The strongest signal was observed at rs9949006 in the ENSG00000263745 gene (OR=1.51, 95\% CI 1.28-1.79, p=1.38E-06). Pathway analyses of the top SNPs implicated genes involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell adhesion and inflammation. Among previously identified ADHD candidate genes, prominent association signals were observed for SLC9A9 (rs1393072, OR=1.46, 95\% CI = 1.21-1.77, p=9.95E-05) and TPH2 (rs17110690, OR = 1.38, 95\% CI = 1.14-1.66, p=8.31E-04).This study confirms the complexity and heterogeneity of ADHD etiology. Taken together with previous findings, our results point to a spectrum of biological mechanisms underlying the symptoms of ADHD, providing targets for further genetic exploration of this complex disorder.},

  abstract    = {Autism imposes a major impediment to childhood development and a huge emotional and financial burden on society. In recent years, there has been rapidly accumulating genetic evidence that links the eNHE, a subset of Na(+)/H(+) exchangers that localize to intracellular vesicles, to a variety of neurological conditions including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, and epilepsy. By providing a leak pathway for protons pumped by the V-ATPase, eNHE determine luminal pH and regulate cation (Na(+), K(+)) content in early and recycling endosomal compartments. Loss-of-function mutations in eNHE cause hyperacidification of endosomal lumen, as a result of imbalance in pump and leak pathways. Two isoforms, NHE6 and NHE9 are highly expressed in brain, including hippocampus and cortex. Here, we summarize evidence for the importance of luminal cation content and pH on processing, delivery and fate of cargo. Drawing upon insights from model organisms and mammalian cells we show how eNHE affect surface expression and function of membrane receptors and neurotransmitter transporters. These studies lead to cellular models of eNHE activity in pre- and post-synaptic neurons and astrocytes, where they could impact synapse development and plasticity. The study of eNHE has provided new insight on the mechanism of autism and other debilitating neurological disorders and opened up new possibilities for therapeutic intervention.},

Such data are not available for ADHD. We combine evidence for new etiologic pathways with bioinformatics data to assess the possibility that existing drugs might be repositioning for treating ADHD. We use this approach to determine if prior data implicating the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 9 gene (SLC9A9) in ADHD implicate sodium/hydrogen exchange (NHE) inhibitors as potential treatments. We assessed the potential for repositioning by assessing the similarity of drug-protein binding profiles between NHE inhibitors and drugs known to treat ADHD using the Drug Repositioning and Adverse Reaction via Chemical-Protein Interactome server. NHE9 shows a high degree of amino acid similarity between NHE inhibitor sensitive NHEs in the region of the NHE inhibitor recognition site defined for NHE1. We found high correlations in drug-protein binding profiles among most ADHD drugs. The drug-protein binding profiles of some NHE inhibitors were highly correlated with ADHD drugs whereas the profiles for a control set of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were not. Further experimental work should evaluate if NHE inhibitors are suitable for treating ADHD.},

Here we use evolutionary conservation analysis to build a model structure of NHE9 based on the crystal structure of bacterial NhaA and use it to screen autism-associated variants in the human population first by phenotype complementation in yeast, followed by functional analysis in primary cortical astrocytes from mouse. NHE9-GFP localizes to recycling endosomes, where it significantly alkalinizes luminal pH, elevates uptake of transferrin and the neurotransmitter glutamate, and stabilizes surface expression of transferrin receptor and GLAST transporter. In contrast, autism-associated variants L236S, S438P and V176I lack function in astrocytes. Thus, we establish a neurobiological cell model of a candidate gene in autism.

Generally the findings of GWAS relying on ADHD status have been non-significant, but the one study using quantitative measures of symptoms found SLC9A9 and SLC6A1 were associated with inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Accordingly, we performed a GWAS using quantitative measures of each ADHD subtype measured with the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) scale in two community-based samples. This scale captures the full range of attention and kinetic behavior; from high levels of attention and appropriate activity to the inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity associated with ADHD within two community-based samples. Our discovery sample comprised 1,851 participants (mean age = 22.8 years [4.8]; 50.6\% female), while our replication sample comprised 155 participants (mean age = 26.3 years [3.1]; 68.4\% females). Age, sex, age × sex, and age2 were included as covariates and the results from each sample were combined using meta-analysis, then analyzed with a gene-based test to estimate the combined effect of markers within genes. We compare our results with markers that have previously been found to have a strong association with ADHD symptoms. Neither the GWAS nor subsequent meta-analyses yielded genome-wide significant results; the strongest effect was observed at rs2110267 (4.62 × 10-7) for symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. The strongest effect in the gene-based test was for GPR139 on symptoms of inattention (6.40 × 10-5). Replication of this study with larger samples will add to our understanding of the genetic etiology of ADHD.},

SLC9A9 is a membrane protein that regulates the luminal pH of the recycling endosome. We recently reported the interactions of SLC9A9 with two molecules: calcineurin homologous protein (CHP) and receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (RACK1). We also reported two novel SLC9A9 mutations and abnormal gene expression profiles in the brains of an inattentive type rat model of ADHD (WKY/NCrl rat). In this study, we further examined the expression and relationship of SLC9A9 and 9 additional genes (CHP, RACK1, CaM, PPP3R1, PPP1R10, PKCm, CaMKI, NR2B, PLCb1) that may directly or indirectly interact with SLC9A9 in the hippocampus of the WKY/NCrl rat and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of the combined type of ADHD. We found that the expression levels of these genes were significantly correlated, suggesting that they may be coregulated. Principal component analysis identified two main factors that accounted for 94\% of the expression variance of the 10 genes. Significant differences were found for both factors across the 3 different rat strains. The two ADHD rat models (WKY/NCrl and SHR), although different from each other in adulthood, showed similar profiles in adolescence. Both models were significantly different from WKY/NHsd control rats at both ages. The expression abnormalities of each gene were evaluated and their roles in cell signaling processes such as calcium signaling and protein phosphorylation are discussed. Our results suggest that abnormalities in SLC9A9-mediated signaling pathways could contribute to the ADHD phenotype of two rat models (WKY/NCrl and SHR/NCrl), and that the perturbation of the SLC9A9 network is age-dependent.},

  abstract    = {Genes likely play a substantial role in the etiology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the genetic architecture of the disorder is unknown, and prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have not identified a genome-wide significant association. We have conducted a third, independent, multisite GWAS of DSM-IV-TR ADHD.Families were ascertained at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH; N = 309 trios), Washington University at St. Louis (WASH-U; N = 272 trios), and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA; N = 156 trios). Genotyping was conducted with the Illumina Human1M or Human1M-Duo BeadChip platforms. After applying quality control filters, association with ADHD was tested with 835,136 SNPs in 735 DSM-IV ADHD trios from 732 families.Our smallest p value (6.7E-07) did not reach the threshold for genome-wide statistical significance (5.0E-08), but one of the 20 most significant associations was located in a candidate gene of interest for ADHD (SLC9A9, rs9810857, p = 6.4E-6). We also conducted gene-based tests of candidate genes identified in the literature and found additional evidence of association with SLC9A9.We and our colleagues in the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium are working to pool together GWAS samples to establish the large data sets needed to follow-up on these results and to identify genes for ADHD and other disorders.},

  abstract    = {A family was previously identified that cosegregates a pericentric inversion, inv(3)(p14 : q21), with an early-onset developmental condition, characterized by impulsive behavior and intellectual deficit. The inversion breakpoints lie within DOCK3 and SLC9A9 at the p-arm and q-arm, respectively. Based on this report, these genes were selected to be evaluated in a family-based attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) association study.Conners' Parent (CPRS) and Teacher (CTRS) Rating Scales of AD/HD symptoms and Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) measures were collected and a minimal number of tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each gene were selected for analysis. Analyses were performed on families who met research criteria for AD/HD. Using the program, QTDT, each tagging SNP was tested for association with T-scores from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) subscales according to the CTRS and CPRS, and five CPT measures.After adjusting for multiple testing, a SNP in the 3' UTR of SLC9A9, rs1046706, remained significantly associated (false discovery rate, q value <0.05) with scores on the DSM-IV hyperactive-impulsive and total symptom subscales according to the CTRS and errors of commission on the CPT. In addition, an intronic SLC9A9 SNP, rs2360867, remained significantly associated with errors of commission.Our results suggest that SLC9A9 may be related to hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in AD/HD and the disruption of SLC9A9 may be responsible for the behavioral phenotype observed in the inversion family. The association with SLC9A9 is particularly interesting as it was recently implicated in a genome-wide association study for AD/HD. Further investigation of the role of SLC9A9 in AD/HD and other behavioral disorders is warranted.},

  abstract    = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, is a common and highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder that is seen in children and adults. Although heritability is estimated at around 76\%, it has been hard to find genes underlying the disorder. ADHD is a multifactorial disorder, in which many genes, all with a small effect, are thought to cause the disorder in the presence of unfavorable environmental conditions. Whole genome linkage analyses have not yet lead to the identification of genes for ADHD, and results of candidate gene-based association studies have been able to explain only a tiny part of the genetic contribution to disease, either. A novel way of performing hypothesis-free analysis of the genome suitable for the identification of disease risk genes of considerably smaller effect is the genome-wide association study (GWAS). So far, five GWAS have been performed on the diagnosis of ADHD and related phenotypes. Four of these are based on a sample set of 958 parent-child trio's collected as part of the International Multicentre ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) study and genotyped with funds from the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN). The other is a pooled GWAS including adult patients with ADHD and controls. None of the papers reports any associations that are formally genome-wide significant after correction for multiple testing. There is also very limited overlap between studies, apart from an association with CDH13, which is reported in three of the studies. Little evidence supports an important role for the 'classic' ADHD genes, with possible exceptions for SLC9A9, NOS1 and CNR1. There is extensive overlap with findings from other psychiatric disorders. Though not genome-wide significant, findings from the individual studies converge to paint an interesting picture: whereas little evidence-as yet-points to a direct involvement of neurotransmitters (at least the classic dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways) or regulators of neurotransmission, some suggestions are found for involvement of 'new' neurotransmission and cell-cell communication systems. A potential involvement of potassium channel subunits and regulators warrants further investigation. More basic processes also seem involved in ADHD, like cell division, adhesion (especially via cadherin and integrin systems), neuronal migration, and neuronal plasticity, as well as related transcription, cell polarity and extracellular matrix regulation, and cytoskeletal remodeling processes. In conclusion, the GWAS performed so far in ADHD, though far from conclusive, provide a first glimpse at genes for the disorder. Many more (much larger studies) will be needed. For this, collaboration between researchers as well as standardized protocols for phenotyping and DNA-collection will become increasingly important.},

  abstract    = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition with environmental and genetic etiologies. Up to this point, research has identified genetic associations with candidate genes from known biological pathways. In order to identify novel ADHD susceptibility genes, 600,000 SNPs were genotyped in 958 ADHD proband-parent trios. After applying data cleaning procedures we examined 429,981 autosomal SNPs in 909 family trios. We generated six quantitative phenotypes from 18 ADHD symptoms to be used in genome-wide association analyses. With the PBAT screening algorithm, we identified 2 SNPs, rs6565113 and rs552655 that met the criteria for significance within a specified phenotype. These SNPs are located in intronic regions of genes CDH13 and GFOD1, respectively. CDH13 has been implicated previously in substance use disorders. We also evaluated the association of SNPs from a list of 37 ADHD candidate genes that was specified a priori. These findings, along with association P-values with a magnitude less than 10(-5), are discussed in this manuscript. Seventeen of these candidate genes had association P-values lower then 0.01: SLC6A1, SLC9A9, HES1, ADRB2, HTR1E, DDC, ADRA1A, DBH, DRD2, BDNF, TPH2, HTR2A, SLC6A2, PER1, CHRNA4, SNAP25, and COMT. Among the candidate genes, SLC9A9 had the strongest overall associations with 58 association test P-values lower than 0.01 and multiple association P-values at a magnitude of 10(-5) in this gene. In sum, these findings identify novel genetic associations at viable ADHD candidate genes and provide confirmatory evidence for associations at previous candidate genes. Replication of these results is necessary in order to confirm the proposed genetic variants for ADHD.},

Large genomic clones (P1 derived/yeast/bacterial artificial chromosomes) were assembled into contigs across the two inversion breakpoints using molecular and bioinformatic technologies. Restriction fragments crossing the junctions were identified by Southern analysis and these fragments were amplified using inverse PCR.The amplification products were subsequently sequenced to reveal that the breakpoints lay within an intron of the dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3) gene at the p arm breakpoint, and an intron of a novel member of the solute carrier family 9 (sodium/hydrogen exchanger) isoform 9 (SLC9A9) at the q arm. Both genes are expressed in the brain, but neither of the genes has previously been implicated in developmental or behavioural disorders.These two disrupted genes are candidates for involvement in the pathway leading to the neuropsychological condition in this family.},

  abstract    = {The transmembranal Na(+)/H(+) antiporters transport sodium (or several other monovalent cations) in exchange for H(+) across lipid bilayers in all kingdoms of life. They are critical in pH homeostasis of the cytoplasm and/or organelles. A particularly notable example is the SLC9 gene family, which encodes Na(+)/H(+) exchangers (NHEs) in many species from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In humans, these proteins are associated with the pathophysiology of various diseases. Yet, the most extensively studied Na(+)/H(+) antiporter is Ec-NhaA, the main Na(+)/H(+) antiporter of Escherichia coli.The crystal structure of down-regulated Ec-NhaA, determined at acidic pH, has provided the first structural insights into the antiport mechanism and pH regulation of an Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. It reveals a unique structural fold (called the NhaA fold) in which transmembrane segments (TMs) are organized in inverted-topology repeats, including two antiparallel unfolded regions that cross each other, forming a delicate electrostatic balance in the middle of the membrane. This unique structural fold (The NhaA fold) contributes to the cation binding site and facilitates the rapid conformational changes expected for Ec-NhaA. The NhaA fold has now been recognized to be shared by four Na(+)/H(+) antiporters (bacterial and archaeal) and a Na(+) symporter. Remarkably, no crystal structure of any of the human Na(+)/H(+) antiporters exists. Nevertheless, the Ec-NhaA crystal structure has enabled the structural modeling of NHE1, NHE9, and NHA2, three human plasmalemmal proteins that are members of the SLC9 family that are involved in human pathophysiology. Moreover, as outlined in this review, developments in the field, including cellular and biophysical methods that enable ion levels and fluxes to be measured in intact cells as well as in knockout mice, have led to striking advances in the identification and characterization of plasma membrane NHEs and NHA.Very little is known about the endomembrane isoforms of NHE. These intracellular exchangers may serve a function in cation homeostasis and/or osmoregulation, and not in pH regulation as is the case for the plasmalemmal isoforms. This intriguing possibility should be borne in mind when designing future studies. Future progress towards gaining an understanding of the SLC9 gene family, including its structure-function relationships and regulatory mechanisms in health and in disease, is likely to include insights into the pathophysiology of multiple diseases.},

Mutations of these exchangers cause autism-spectrum disorders and neurodegeneration. NHE6, NHE7, and NHE9 are hypothesized to exchange cytosolic K(+) for H(+) and alkalinize vesicles, but this notion has remained untested in K(+) because their intracellular localization prevents functional measurements. Using proton-killing techniques, we selected a cell line that expresses wild-type NHE7 at the plasma membrane, enabling measurement of the exchanger's transport parameters. We found that NHE7 transports Li(+) and Na(+), but not K(+), is nonreversible in physiological conditions and is constitutively activated by cytosolic H(+). Therefore, NHE7 acts as a proton-loading transporter rather than a proton leak. NHE7 mediates an acidification of intracellular vesicles that is additive to that of V-ATPases and that accelerates endocytosis. This study reveals an unexpected function for vesicular Na(+)/H(+) exchangers and provides clues for understanding NHE-linked neurological disorders.},

The SLC9 gene family (solute carrier classification of transporters: www.bioparadigms.org) is divided into three subgroups [46]. The SLC9A subgroup encompasses plasmalemmal isoforms NHE1-5 (SLC9A1-5) and the predominantly intracellular isoforms NHE6-9 (SLC9A6-9). The SLC9B subgroup consists of two recently cloned isoforms, NHA1 and NHA2 (SLC9B1 and SLC9B2, respectively). The SLC9C subgroup consist of a sperm specific plasmalemmal NHE (SLC9C1) and a putative NHE, SLC9C2, for which there is currently no functional data [46]. NHEs participate in the regulation of cytosolic and organellar pH as well as cell volume. In the intestine and kidney, NHEs are critical for transepithelial movement of Na(+) and HCO3(-) and thus for whole body volume and acid-base homeostasis [46]. Mutations in the NHE6 or NHE9 genes cause neurological disease in humans and are currently the only NHEs directly linked to human disease. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that members of this gene family contribute to the pathophysiology of multiple human diseases.},

NHEs exhibit an appreciable variation in expression, regulation, and physiological function, dictated by their dynamics in subcellular localization and/or interaction with regulatory proteins. In recent years, a subgroup of NHEs consisting of four isoforms has been identified, and its members predominantly localize to the membranes of the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. These organellar NHEs constitute a family of transporters with an emerging function in the regulation of luminal pH and in intracellular membrane trafficking as expressed, for example, in cell polarity development. Moreover, specific roles of a variety of cofactors, regulating the intracellular dynamics of these transporters, are also becoming apparent, thereby providing further insight into their mechanism of action and overall functioning. Interestingly, organellar NHEs have been related to mental disorders, implying a potential role in the brain, thus expanding the physiological significance of these transporters.},

  abstract    = {In mammalian eukaryotic cells, the Na+/H+ exchanger is a family of membrane proteins that regulates ions fluxes across membranes. Plasma membrane isoforms of this protein extrude 1 intracellular proton in exchange for 1 extracellular sodium. The family of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) consists of 9 known isoforms, NHE1-NHE9. The NHE1 isoform was the first discovered, is the best characterized, and exists on the plasma membrane of all mammalian cells. It contains an N-terminal 500 amino acid membrane domain that transports ions, plus a 315 amino acid C-terminal, the intracellular regulatory domain. The Na+/H+ exchanger is regulated by both post-translational modifications including protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation, plus by a number of regulatory-binding proteins including phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, calcineurin homologous protein, ezrin, radixin and moesin, calmodulin, carbonic anhydrase II, and tescalcin. The Na+/H+ exchanger is involved in a variety of complex physiological and pathological events that include regulation of intracellular pH, cell movement, heart disease, and cancer. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of the physiological role and regulation of this protein.},

They are localized to Golgi and post-Golgi endocytic compartments as follows: mid- to trans-Golgi, NHE8; trans-Golgi network, NHE7; early recycling endosomes, NHE6; and late recycling endosomes, NHE9. No significant localization of these NHEs was observed in lysosomes. The distribution of these NHEs is not discrete in the cells, and there is partial overlap with other isoforms, suggesting that the intracellular localization of the NHEs is established by the balance of transport in and out of the post-Golgi compartments as the dynamic membrane trafficking. The overexpression of NHE isoforms increased the luminal pH of the compartments in which the protein resided from the mildly acidic pH to the cytosolic pH, suggesting that their in vivo function is to regulate the pH and monovalent cation concentration in these organelles. We propose that the specific NHE isoforms contribute to the maintenance of the unique acidic pH values of the Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in the cell.},

  abstract    = {Postsynaptic endosomal trafficking has emerged as a principal regulatory mechanism of structural and functional plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. Recycling endosomes perform activity-dependent transport of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and lipids to the postsynaptic membrane, activities that are known to contribute to long-term synaptic potentiation and hypothesized to subserve learning and memory processes in the brain. Recently, genetic defects in a widely expressed vesicular pH-regulating transporter, the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE6 isoform, have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders including severe X-linked mental retardation and autism. However, little information is available regarding the cellular properties of this transporter in the CNS. Here, we show by quantitative light microscopy that the protein abundance of NHE6 is developmentally regulated in area CA1 of the mouse hippocampus. Within pyramidal neurons, NHE6 was found to localize to discrete puncta throughout the soma and neurites, with noticeable accumulation at dendritic spines and presynaptic terminals. Dual immunolabeling of dendritic spines revealed that NHE6 partially colocalizes with typical markers of early and recycling endosomes as well as with the AMPAR subunit GluA1. Significantly, NHE6-containing vesicles exhibited enhanced translocation to dendritic spine heads during NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation. These data suggest that NHE6 may play a unique, previously unrecognized, role at glutamatergic synapses that are important for learning and memory.},

Spines form and grow during long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. However, the source of membrane for spine formation and enlargement is unknown. Here we report that membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes is required for the growth and maintenance of spines. Using live-cell imaging and serial section electron microscopy, we demonstrate that LTP-inducing stimuli promote the mobilization of recycling endosomes and vesicles into spines. Preventing recycling endosomal transport abolishes LTP-induced spine formation. Using a pH-sensitive recycling cargo, we show that exocytosis from recycling endosomes occurs locally in spines, is triggered by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors, and occurs concurrently with spine enlargement. Thus, recycling endosomes provide membrane for activity-dependent spine growth and remodeling, defining a novel membrane trafficking mechanism for spine morphological plasticity and providing a mechanistic link between structural and functional plasticity during LTP.},

The aim of the current study was therefore to examine the effects of THC on frontolimbic activation and functional connectivity during cognitive reappraisal in a sample of healthy adults. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject design and all participants ingested either an oral dose of synthetic THC (n=41) or placebo (n=37) before completion of an emotion regulation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Functional connectivity was assessed using generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses. Results indicated that although there were no group differences in self-reported attenuation of negative affect during cognitive reappraisal, relative to placebo, THC increased amygdala activation and reduced amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) functional coupling during cognitive reappraisal of emotionally negative pictures. This suggests that in addition to automatic emotional processes, THC affects frontolimbic functioning during cognitive reappraisal.},

However, the effect of cannabinoids on the underlying neural circuitry of extinction memory recall in humans has not been demonstrated. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design (N=14/group) coupled with a standard Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm and an acute pharmacological challenge with oral dronabinol (synthetic THC) in healthy adult volunteers. We examined the effects of THC on vmPFC and HIPP activation when tested for recall of extinction learning 24 h after extinction learning. Compared to subjects who received placebo, participants who received THC showed increased vmPFC and HIPP activation to a previously extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS+E) during extinction memory recall. This study provides the first evidence that pre-extinction administration of THC modulates prefrontal-limbic circuits during fear extinction in humans and prompts future investigation to test if cannabinoid agonists can rescue or correct the impaired behavioral and neural function during extinction recall in patients with PTSD. Ultimately, the cannabinoid system may serve as a promising target for innovative intervention strategies (e.g. pharmacological enhancement of exposure-based therapy) in PTSD and other fear learning-related disorders.},

  abstract    = {A first-line approach to treat anxiety disorders is exposure-based therapy, which relies on extinction processes such as repeatedly exposing the patient to stimuli (conditioned stimuli; CS) associated with the traumatic, fear-related memory. However, a significant number of patients fail to maintain their gains, partly attributed to the fact that this inhibitory learning and its maintenance is temporary and conditioned fear responses can return. Animal studies have shown that activation of the cannabinoid system during extinction learning enhances fear extinction and its retention. Specifically, CB1 receptor agonists, such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), can facilitate extinction recall by preventing recovery of extinguished fear in rats. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in humans. We conducted a study using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, coupling a standard Pavlovian fear extinction paradigm and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) recording with an acute pharmacological challenge with oral dronabinol (synthetic THC) or placebo (PBO) 2 h prior to extinction learning in 29 healthy adult volunteers (THC = 14; PBO = 15) and tested extinction retention 24 h after extinction learning. Compared to subjects that received PBO, subjects that received THC showed low SCR to a previously extinguished CS when extinction memory recall was tested 24 h after extinction learning, suggesting that THC prevented the recovery of fear. These results provide the first evidence that pharmacological enhancement of extinction learning is feasible in humans using cannabinoid system modulators, which may thus warrant further development and clinical testing.

  abstract    = {The persistence of associative memories linked to the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse is a core underlying feature of the addiction process. Opiate class drugs in particular, possess potent euphorigenic effects which, when linked to environmental cues, can produce drug-related "trigger" memories that may persist for lengthy periods of time, even during abstinence, in both humans, and other animals. Furthermore, the transitional switch from the drug-naïve, non-dependent state to states of dependence and withdrawal, represents a critical boundary between distinct neuronal and molecular substrates associated with opiate-reward memory formation. Identifying the functional molecular and neuronal mechanisms related to the acquisition, consolidation, recall, and extinction phases of opiate-related reward memories is critical for understanding, and potentially reversing, addiction-related memory plasticity characteristic of compulsive drug-seeking behaviors. The mammalian prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) share important functional and anatomical connections that are involved importantly in the processing of associative memories linked to drug reward. In addition, both regions share interconnections with the mesolimbic pathway's ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) and can modulate dopamine (DA) transmission and neuronal activity associated with drug-related DAergic signaling dynamics. In this review, we will summarize research from both human and animal modeling studies highlighting the importance of neuronal and molecular plasticity mechanisms within this circuitry during critical phases of opiate addiction-related learning and memory processing. Specifically, we will focus on two molecular signaling pathways known to be involved in both drug-related neuroadaptations and in memory-related plasticity mechanisms; the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase system (ERK) and the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK). Evidence will be reviewed that points to the importance of critical molecular memory switches within the mammalian brain that might mediate the neuropathological adaptations resulting from chronic opiate exposure, dependence, and withdrawal.},

  abstract    = {Recent work on the extinction of fear-motivated learning places emphasis on its putative circuitry and on its modulation. Extinction is the learned inhibition of retrieval of previously acquired responses. Fear extinction is used as a major component of exposure therapy in the treatment of fear memories such as those of the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is initiated and maintained by interactions between the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which involve feedback regulation of the latter by the other two areas. Fear extinction depends on NMDA receptor activation. It is positively modulated by d-serine acting on the glycine site of NMDA receptors and blocked by AP5 (2-amino-5-phosphono propionate) in the three structures. In addition, histamine acting on H2 receptors and endocannabinoids acting on CB1 receptors in the three brain areas mentioned, and muscarinic cholinergic fibers from the medial septum to hippocampal CA1 positively modulate fear extinction. Importantly, fear extinction can be made state-dependent on circulating epinephrine, which may play a role in situations of stress. Exposure to a novel experience can strongly enhance the consolidation of fear extinction through a synaptic tagging and capture mechanism; this may be useful in the therapy of states caused by fear memory like PTSD.},

  abstract    = {Emerging evidence from both basic and clinical research demonstrates an important role for endocannabinoid (ECB) signaling in the processing of emotionally salient information, learning, and memory. Cannabinoid transmission within neural circuits involved in emotional processing has been shown to modulate the acquisition, recall, and extinction of emotionally salient memories and importantly, can strongly modulate the emotional salience of incoming sensory information. Two neural regions in particular, the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), play important roles in emotional regulation and contain high levels of cannabinoid receptors. Furthermore, both regions show profound abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that cannabinoid transmission functionally interacts with dopamine (DA), a neurotransmitter system that is of exceptional importance for both addictive behaviors and the neuropsychopathology of disorders like schizophrenia. Research in our laboratory has focused on how cannabinoid transmission both within and extrinsic to the mesolimbic DA system, including the BLA → mPFC circuitry, can modulate both rewarding and aversive emotional information. In this review, we will summarize clinical and basic neuroscience research demonstrating the importance of cannabinoid signaling within this neural circuitry. In particular, evidence will be reviewed emphasizing the importance of cannabinoid signaling within the BLA → mPFC circuitry in the context of emotional salience processing, memory formation and memory-related plasticity. We propose that aberrant states of hyper or hypoactive ECB signaling within the amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuit may lead to dysregulation of mesocorticolimbic DA transmission controlling the processing of emotionally salient information. These disturbances may in turn lead to emotional processing, learning, and memory abnormalities related to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction and schizophrenia-related psychoses.},

  abstract    = {The burden of anxiety disorders is growing, but the efficacy of available anxiolytic treatments remains inadequate. Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders focuses on identifying and modifying maladaptive patterns of thinking and behaving, and has a testable analogue in rodents in the form of fear extinction. A large preclinical literature has amassed in recent years describing the neural and molecular basis of fear extinction in rodents. In this review, we discuss how this work is being harnessed to foster translational research on anxiety disorders and facilitate the search for new anxiolytic treatments. We begin by summarizing the anatomical and functional connectivity of a medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-amygdala circuit that subserves fear extinction, including new insights from optogenetics. We then cover some of the approaches that have been taken to model impaired fear extinction and associated impairments with mPFC-amygdala dysfunction. The principal goal of the review is to evaluate evidence that various neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems mediate fear extinction by modulating the mPFC-amygdala circuitry. To that end, we describe studies that have tested how fear extinction is impaired or facilitated by pharmacological manipulations of dopamine, noradrenaline, 5-HT, GABA, glutamate, neuropeptides, endocannabinoids and various other systems, which either directly target the mPFC-amygdala circuit, or produce behavioural effects that are coincident with functional changes in the circuit. We conclude that there are good grounds to be optimistic that the progress in defining the molecular substrates of mPFC-amygdala circuit function can be effectively leveraged to identify plausible candidates for extinction-promoting therapies for anxiety disorders.},

  abstract    = {There is considerable interest, from both a basic and clinical standpoint, in gaining a greater understanding of how pharmaceutical or behavioral manipulations alter fear extinction in animals. Not only does fear extinction in rodents model exposure therapy in humans, where the latter is a cornerstone of behavioral intervention for anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and specific phobias, but also understanding more about extinction provides basic information into learning and memory processes and their underlying circuitry. In this paper, we briefly review three principal approaches that have been used to modulate extinction processes in animals and humans: a purely pharmacological approach, the more widespread approach of combining pharmacology with behavior, and a purely behavioral approach. The pharmacological studies comprise modulation by: brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), d-cycloserine, serotonergic and noradrenergic drugs, neuropeptides, endocannabinoids, glucocorticoids, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and others. These studies strongly suggest that extinction can be modulated by drugs, behavioral interventions, or their combination, although not always in a lasting manner. We suggest that pharmacotherapeutic manipulations provide considerable promise for promoting effective and lasting fear reduction in individuals with anxiety disorders.

Dopamine has been shown to be critical for many processes that drive learning and memory, including motivation, prediction error, incentive salience, memory consolidation, and response output. Theories of dopamine's function in these processes have, for the most part, been developed from behavioral approaches that examine learning mechanisms in reward-related tasks. A parallel and growing literature indicates that dopamine is involved in fear conditioning and extinction. These studies are consistent with long-standing ideas about appetitive-aversive interactions in learning theory and they speak to the general nature of cellular and molecular processes that underlie behavior. We review the behavioral and neurobiological literature showing a role for dopamine in fear conditioning and extinction. At a cellular level, we review dopamine signaling and receptor pharmacology, cellular and molecular events that follow dopamine receptor activation, and brain systems in which dopamine functions. At a behavioral level, we describe theories of learning and dopamine function that could describe the fundamental rules underlying how dopamine modulates different aspects of learning and memory processes.},

  abstract    = {Fear extinction is a form of inhibitory learning that allows for the adaptive control of conditioned fear responses. Although fear extinction is an active learning process that eventually leads to the formation of a consolidated extinction memory, it is a fragile behavioural state. Fear responses can recover spontaneously or subsequent to environmental influences, such as context changes or stress. Understanding the neuronal substrates of fear extinction is of tremendous clinical relevance, as extinction is the cornerstone of psychological therapy of several anxiety disorders and because the relapse of maladaptative fear and anxiety is a major clinical problem. Recent research has begun to shed light on the molecular and cellular processes underlying fear extinction. In particular, the acquisition, consolidation and expression of extinction memories are thought to be mediated by highly specific neuronal circuits embedded in a large-scale brain network including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and brain stem. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the neuronal circuitry of extinction is developmentally regulated. Here, we review emerging concepts of the neuronal circuitry of fear extinction, and highlight novel findings suggesting that the fragile phenomenon of extinction can be converted into a permanent erasure of fear memories. Finally, we discuss how research on genetic animal models of impaired extinction can further our understanding of the molecular and genetic bases of human anxiety disorders.},

  abstract    = {Acquisition and storage of aversive memories is one of the basic principles of central nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom. In the absence of reinforcement, the resulting behavioural response will gradually diminish to be finally extinct. Despite the importance of extinction, its cellular mechanisms are largely unknown. The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and endocannabinoids are present in memory-related brain areas and modulate memory. Here we show that the endogenous cannabinoid system has a central function in extinction of aversive memories. CB1-deficient mice showed strongly impaired short-term and long-term extinction in auditory fear-conditioning tests, with unaffected memory acquisition and consolidation. Treatment of wild-type mice with the CB1 antagonist SR141716A mimicked the phenotype of CB1-deficient mice, revealing that CB1 is required at the moment of memory extinction. Consistently, tone presentation during extinction trials resulted in elevated levels of endocannabinoids in the basolateral amygdala complex, a region known to control extinction of aversive memories. In the basolateral amygdala, endocannabinoids and CB1 were crucially involved in long-term depression of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibitory currents. We propose that endocannabinoids facilitate extinction of aversive memories through their selective inhibitory effects on local inhibitory networks in the amygdala.},

Recent years have witnessed an impressive growth in our understanding of the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms underlying emotional memory formation. As a consequence, interest has emerged in developing strategies for suppressing, if not eliminating, fear memories. Here, I review recent work employing sophisticated behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular tools to target fear memories, placing these memories firmly behind the crosshairs of neurobiologically informed interventions.},

Pavlovian conditioning and extinction are particularly influential in defining learning stages that can account for symptoms of anxiety disorders. Recently, dynamic and task related communication between the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged as a crucial aspect of successful evaluation of threat and safety. Ongoing patterns of neural signaling within the mPFC-BLA circuit during encoding, expression and extinction of adaptive learning are reviewed. The mechanisms whereby deficient mPFC-BLA interactions can lead to generalized fear and anxiety are discussed in learned and innate anxiety. Findings with cross-species validity are emphasized.},

  abstract    = {The last 10 years have witnessed a surge of interest for the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and extinction of classically conditioned fear responses. In part, this results from the realization that abnormalities in fear learning mechanisms likely participate in the development and/or maintenance of human anxiety disorders. The simplicity and robustness of this learning paradigm, coupled with the fact that the underlying circuitry is evolutionarily well conserved, make it an ideal model to study the basic biology of memory and identify genetic factors and neuronal systems that regulate the normal and pathological expressions of learned fear. Critical advances have been made in determining how modified neuronal functions upon fear acquisition become stabilized during fear memory consolidation and how these processes are controlled in the course of fear memory extinction. With these advances came the realization that activity in remote neuronal networks must be coordinated for these events to take place. In this paper, we review these mechanisms of coordinated network activity and the molecular cascades leading to enduring fear memory, and allowing for their extinction. We will focus on Pavlovian fear conditioning as a model and the amygdala as a key component for the acquisition and extinction of fear responses.},

A number of studies for amygdala neural circuits that underlie fear conditioning have elucidated specific cellular and molecular mechanisms of emotional memory. Recent technical advances such as optogenetic approaches have not only confirmed the importance of excitatory circuits in fear conditioning, but have also shed new light for a direct role of inhibitory circuits in both the acquisition and extinction of fear memory in addition to their role in fine tuning of excitatory neural circuitry. As a result, the circuits in amygdala could be drawn more elaborately, and it led us to understand how fear or extinction memories are formed in the detailed circuit level, and various neuromodulators affect these circuit activities, inducing subtle behavioral changes.},

Based on the analysis of protein kinase signaling patterns in neurons of the fear circuit, we propose that fear and extinction are best conceptualized as emotional states triggered by a single CS representation with two opposing values: aversive and non-aversive. These values are conferred by the presence or absence of the US and encoded by distinct sets of kinase signaling pathways and their downstream targets. Modulating specific protein kinases thus has the potential to modify emotional states, and hence, may emerge as a promising treatment for anxiety disorders.},

The EEG power spectra and the TGC data were analyzed. Correlation analyses between the Intermediate Visual and Auditory (IVA) continuous performance test (CPT) scores and EEG parameters were performed.No significant difference in the power spectra was detected between the groups at rest and during task performance. However, TGC was reduced during the arithmetic task in the ADHD group compared with the normal group (F = 16.70, p < 0.001). The TGC values positively correlated with the IVA CPT scores but negatively correlated with theta power.Our findings suggest that desynchronization of TGC occurred during the arithmetic task in ADHD children. TGC in ADHD children is expected to serve as a promising neurophysiological marker of network deactivation during attention-demanding tasks.},

Electroencephalography was assessed in the resting-state, and qEEG data were obtained in the eyes-closed state. The Korean version of the ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) and continuous performance tests (CPTs) were used to assess all participants.Theta-band (4-7 Hz) power across the brain was significantly positively correlated with inattention scores on the K-ARS, reaction times and commission errors on the CPTs in ADHD patients. Gamma-band (31-50 Hz) power was significantly positively correlated with the results of the auditory CPTs in ADHD patients. The theta/alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta/beta (13-30 Hz) ratios were significantly negatively correlated with commission and omission errors on auditory CPTs in ADHD patients.

  abstract    = {This survey covers the potential use of neurophysiological changes as a biomarker in four neuropsychiatric diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ)). Great developments have been made in the search of biomarkers in these disorders, especially in AD. Nevertheless, there is a tremendous need to develop an efficient, low-cost, potentially portable, non-invasive biomarker in the diagnosis, course, or treatment of the above-mentioned disorders. Electrophysiological methods would provide a tool that would reflect functional brain dynamic changes within milliseconds and also may be used as an ensemble of biomarkers that is greatly needed in the evaluation of cognitive changes seen in these disorders. The strategies for measuring cognitive changes include spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG), sensory evoked oscillation (SEO), and event-related oscillations (ERO). Further selective connectivity deficit in sensory or cognitive networks is reflected by coherence measurements. Possible candidate biomarkers discussed in an interactive panel can be summarized as follows: for ADHD: (a) elevation of delta and theta, (b) diminished alpha and beta responses in spontaneous EEG; for SZ: (a) decrease of ERO gamma responses, (b) decreased ERO in all other frequency ranges, (c) invariant ERO gamma response in relation to working memory demand; for euthymic BD: (a) decreased event-related gamma coherence, (b) decreased alpha in ERO and in spontaneous EEG; for manic BD: (a) lower alpha and higher beta in ERO, (b) decreased event-related gamma coherence, (c) lower alpha and beta in ERO after valproate; and for AD: (a) decreased alpha and beta, and increased theta and delta in spontaneous EEG, (b) hyperexcitability of motor cortices as shown by transcortical magnetic stimulation, (c) hyperexcitability of visual sensory cortex as indicated by increased SEO theta responses, (d) lower delta ERO, (e) lower delta, theta, and alpha event-related coherence, (f) higher theta synchrony and higher alpha event-related coherence in cholinergically treated AD subjects. In further research in the search for biomarkers, multimodal methods should be introduced to electrophysiology for validation purposes. Also, providing the protocols for standardization and harmonization of user-friendly acquisition or analysis methods that would be applied in larger cohort populations should be used to incorporate these electrophysiologic methods into the clinical criteria. In an extension to conventional anatomical, biochemical and brain imaging biomarkers, the use of neurophysiologic markers may lead to new applications for functional interpretrations and also the possibility to monitor treatments tailored for individuals.},

  abstract    = {Our perspective on resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) is that it provides a window into the substrate of cognitive and perceptual processing, reflecting the dynamic potential of the brain's current functional state. In an extended research program into the electrophysiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), we have examined resting-state EEG power and coherence, and event-related potentials (ERPs), in children, adolescents, and adults with the disorder. We sought initially to identify consistent AD/HD anomalies in these measures, relative to normal control subjects, and then to understand how these differences related to existing models of AD/HD. An emergent strand in this program has been to clarify the EEG correlates of "arousal" and to understand the role of arousal dysfunction as a core anomaly in AD/HD. To date, findings in this strand serve to rule out a commonly held dictum in the AD/HD field: that elevated theta/beta ratio is an indicator of hypo-arousal. In turn, this requires further work to elucidate the ratio's functional significance in the disorder. Our brain dynamics studies relating prestimulus EEG amplitude and phase states to ERP outcomes are expected to help in this regard, but we are still at a relatively early stage, currently examining these relationships in control children, in order to better understand normal aspects of brain dynamics before turning to children with AD/HD. This range of studies provides a framework for our recent work relating resting-state EEG anomalies, in individuals with AD/HD, to their symptom profile. This has had promising results, indicating links between increased inattention scores and reduced resting EEG gamma power. With resting-state EEG coherence, reduced left lateralized coherences across several bands have correlated negatively with inattention scores, while reduced frontal interhemispheric coherence has been correlated negatively with hyperactivity/impulsivity scores. Such linkages appear to provide encouraging leads for future EEG research in AD/HD.},

Several studies demonstrated functional variations in patients with ADHD especially during response inhibition and flexibility. However, information about functional correlates of other aspects of executive functions such as voluntary selection processes is limited. A group of thirty adult patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 30 healthy controls, matched for age and education, participated in the present study. Electrophysiological responses (event-related potentials, gamma oscillations) and behavioural data were acquired during the voluntary selection between various response alternatives. ADHD patients demonstrated increased responses in the gamma frequency band especially in frontal and fronto-central brain areas during voluntary response selection processes compared to healthy subjects. In addition, the error rate was increased in patients. Given that gamma-band responses have been related to GABAergic and glutamatergic responses these results may indicate accordant dysfunction in patients with ADHD.},

Over longer inter-electrode distances, the AD/HD group had reduced intrahemispheric coherence in alpha. In interhemispheric comparisons, the AD/HD group had reduced frontal coherence in delta, alpha and gamma, increased temporal theta and reduced temporal alpha coherences, and increased central/parietal/occipital coherence in theta. Smaller left-lateralized coherences in AD/HD correlated negatively with DSM Inattentive and DSM Total scores, and smaller frontal interhemispheric coherence in alpha correlated negatively with DSM Hyperactive/Impulsive score.The negative correlations between AD/HD coherence anomalies and symptoms suggest that several anomalies reflect compensatory brain function.Coherence differences in AD/HD may reflect anomalous frontal right-hemisphere linkages that help compensate functional brain anomalies in the left frontal regions in this disorder.},

More than 40 years of electroencephalography (EEG)-based research has culminated in the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the theta/beta (EEG power) ratio (TBR) as a diagnostic marker of ADHD.This review article focuses on resting-state EEG power research in ADHD.Inconsistent findings in the literature and suggestions of reduced specificity threaten the utility of TBR as a biomarker of ADHD. The use of fixed EEG bands may be a significant limitation, particularly in youth, and alternative approaches are needed.We propose that a personalized theta-to-alpha cut point or "transition frequency" is a better frame of reference for the measurement of TBR. Such an approach is better placed to test maturational lag and cortical hypoarousal models of ADHD and may in turn have greater utility in supporting diagnosis.},

Considering the clinical heterogeneity of ADHD and the complexity of information available from the EEG signals, we suggest that considerable benefits are to be gained from multivariate analyses and a focus towards understanding of the neural generators of EEG. We conclude that while EEG cannot currently be used as a diagnostic tool, vast developments in analytical and technological tools in its domain anticipate future progress in its utility in the clinical setting.},

  abstract    = {Gamma oscillations in neocortex are hypothesized to improve information transmission between groups of neurons. We recently showed that optogenetic drive of fast-spiking interneurons (FS) at 40 Hz in mouse neocortex in vivo modulates the spike count and precision of sensory evoked responses. At specific phases of alignment between stimuli and FS activation, total evoked spike count was unchanged compared to baseline, but precision was increased. In the present study, we used computational modeling to investigate the origin of these local transformations, and to make predictions about their impact on downstream signal transmission. We replicated the prior experimental findings, and found that the local gain observed can be explained by mutual inhibition of fast-spiking interneurons, leading to more robust sensory-driven spiking in a brief temporal window post-stimulus, increasing local synchrony. Enhanced spiking in a second neocortical area, without a net increase in overall driven spikes in the first area, resulted from faster depolarization of target neurons due to increased pre-synaptic synchrony. In addition, we found that the precise temporal structure of spiking in the first area impacted the gain between cortical areas. The optimal spike distribution matched the "window of opportunity" defined by the timing of inhibition in the target area: spiking beyond this window did not contribute to downstream spike generation, leading to decreased overall gain. This result predicts that efficient transmission between neocortical areas requires a mechanism to dynamically match the temporal structure of the output of one area to the timing of inhibition in the recipient zone.},

A common, effective treatment strategy involves repeated presentations to the feared cue without any danger (extinction). However, extinction learning has a number of important limitations, and enhancing its effects, generalizability and durability via cognitive enhancers may improve its therapeutic impact. In this review we focus specifically on the role of the cannabinoid system in fear extinction learning and its retention. We address the following questions: What are the neural circuits mediating fear extinction?; Can we make fear extinction more effective?; Can cannabinoids facilitate fear extinction in humans?; How might the cannabinoid system effect fear extinction? Collectively, translational evidence suggest that enhancing cannabinoid transmission may facilitate extinction learning and its recall, and that the cannabinoid system is a potential pharmacological target for improving the active learning that occurs during exposure-based behavioral treatments prompting future research in terms of mechanisms research, novel treatment approaches ('cognitive enhancers'), and pharmacotherapeutic drug discovery.},

Participants received 32 mg of CBD either following before or after extinction in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. At recall, 48 h later, participants were exposed to CSs and conditioning contexts before (recall) and after (reinstatement) exposure to the UCS. Skin conductance and shock expectancy measures of conditioned responding were recorded throughout.Successful conditioning, extinction and recall were found in all three treatment groups. CBD given post-extinction enhanced consolidation of extinction learning as assessed by shock expectancy. CBD administered at either time produced trend level reduction in reinstatement of autonomic contextual responding. No acute effects of CBD were found on extinction.These findings provide the first evidence that CBD can enhance consolidation of extinction learning in humans and suggest that CBD may have potential as an adjunct to extinction-based therapies for anxiety disorders.},

  abstract    = {Human neocortical 15-29-Hz beta oscillations are strong predictors of perceptual and motor performance. However, the mechanistic origin of beta in vivo is unknown, hindering understanding of its functional role. Combining human magnetoencephalography (MEG), computational modeling, and laminar recordings in animals, we present a new theory that accounts for the origin of spontaneous neocortical beta. In our MEG data, spontaneous beta activity from somatosensory and frontal cortex emerged as noncontinuous beta events typically lasting <150 ms with a stereotypical waveform. Computational modeling uniquely designed to infer the electrical currents underlying these signals showed that beta events could emerge from the integration of nearly synchronous bursts of excitatory synaptic drive targeting proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where the defining feature of a beta event was a strong distal drive that lasted one beta period (∼50 ms). This beta mechanism rigorously accounted for the beta event profiles; several other mechanisms did not. The spatial location of synaptic drive in the model to supragranular and infragranular layers was critical to the emergence of beta events and led to the prediction that beta events should be associated with a specific laminar current profile. Laminar recordings in somatosensory neocortex from anesthetized mice and awake monkeys supported these predictions, suggesting this beta mechanism is conserved across species and recording modalities. These findings make several predictions about optimal states for perceptual and motor performance and guide causal interventions to modulate beta for optimal function.},

  abstract    = {Preclinical evidence implicates several neurotransmitter systems in the extinction of conditioned fear. These results are of great interest, because the reduction of acquired fear associations is critical in therapies for anxiety disorders. We tested whether findings with respect to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and cannabinoid receptor (CB) systems in animals carry over to healthy human subjects. To that end, we administered selected doses of D-cycloserine (partial NMDA receptor agonist, 250 mg), delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, CB(1) receptor agonist, 10 mg), or placebo prior to the extinction session of a 3-day conditioning protocol. D-cycloserine did not affect within-session extinction, or the retention of extinction in healthy human participants, in contrast with patient data but in line with previous reports in healthy volunteers. During extinction training, Δ9-THC reduced conditioned skin conductance responses, but not fear-potentiated startle. This effect was not retained at the retention test 2 days later, suggesting it was dependent on acute effects of the drug. Our findings implicate that facilitation of the CB(1) or NMDA system with the substances used in this study does not affect conditioned fear extinction lastingly in healthy humans. The apparent discrepancy between these findings and the results from (pre-)clinical trials is discussed in terms of room for improvement in these systems in healthy volunteers, and the lack of specificity of THC as a CB(1) agonist.},

Recent findings that have been made using these tools and techniques have provided mechanistic insights into the exquisite organization of the circuitry underlying internal defensive states. This Review focuses on studies that have used circuit-based approaches to gain a more detailed, and also more comprehensive and integrated, view on how the brain governs fear and anxiety and how it orchestrates adaptive defensive behaviours.},

  abstract    = {Since the 19th century, there has been disagreement over the fundamental question of whether "emotions" are cause or consequence of their associated behaviors. This question of causation is most directly addressable in genetically tractable model organisms, including invertebrates such as Drosophila. Yet there is ongoing debate about whether such species even have "emotions," as emotions are typically defined with reference to human behavior and neuroanatomy. Here, we argue that emotional behaviors are a class of behaviors that express internal emotion states. These emotion states exhibit certain general functional and adaptive properties that apply across any specific human emotions like fear or anger, as well as across phylogeny. These general properties, which can be thought of as "emotion primitives," can be modeled and studied in evolutionarily distant model organisms, allowing functional dissection of their mechanistic bases and tests of their causal relationships to behavior. More generally, our approach not only aims at better integration of such studies in model organisms with studies of emotion in humans, but also suggests a revision of how emotion should be operationalized within psychology and psychiatry.},

It is maintained by spatially tuned, recurrent excitation within networks of prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons, evident during delay periods in WM tasks. Stimulation of postsynaptic alpha2A adrenoceptors (alpha2A-ARs) is critical for WM. We report that alpha2A-AR stimulation strengthens WM through inhibition of cAMP, closing Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and strengthening the functional connectivity of PFC networks. Ultrastructurally, HCN channels and alpha2A-ARs were colocalized in dendritic spines in PFC. In electrophysiological studies, either alpha2A-AR stimulation, cAMP inhibition or HCN channel blockade enhanced spatially tuned delay-related firing of PFC neurons. Conversely, delay-related network firing collapsed under conditions of excessive cAMP. In behavioral studies, either blockade or knockdown of HCN1 channels in PFC improved WM performance. These data reveal a powerful mechanism for rapidly altering the strength of WM networks in PFC.},

  abstract    = {In anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorders and phobias, classical conditioning pairs natural (unconditioned) fear-eliciting stimuli with contextual or discrete cues resulting in enduring fear responses to multiple stimuli. Extinction is an active learning process that results in a reduction of conditioned fear responses after conditioned stimuli are no longer paired with unconditioned stimuli. Fear extinction often produces incomplete effects and this highlights the relative permanence of bonds between conditioned stimuli and conditioned fear responses. The animal research literature is rich in its demonstration of cognitive enhancing agents that alter fear extinction. This review specifically examines the fear extinguishing effects of cognitive enhancers that act on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamatergic, cholinergic, adrenergic, dopaminergic, and cannabinoid signaling pathways. It also examines the effects of compounds that alter epigenetic and neurotrophic mechanisms in fear extinction. Of these cognitive enhancers, glutamatergic N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists, such as D-cycloserine, have enhanced fear extinction in a context-, dose- and time-dependent manner. Agents that function as glutamatergic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor agonists, alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists (such as yohimbine), neurotrophic factors (brain derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (valproate and sodium butyrate) also improve fear extinction in animals. However, some have anxiogenic effects and their contextual and temporal effects need to be more reliably demonstrated. Various cognitive enhancers produce changes in cortico-amygdala synaptic plasticity through multiple mechanisms and these neural changes enhance fear extinction. We need to better define the changes in neural plasticity produced by these agents in order to develop more effective compounds. In the clinical setting, such use of effective cognitive enhancers with cue exposure therapy, using compounds derived from animal model studies, provides great hope for the future treatment of anxiety disorders.},

  abstract    = {Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric chronic disease developing in individuals after the experience of an intense and life-threatening traumatic event. The post-traumatic symptomatology encompasses alterations in memory processes, mood, anxiety and arousal. There is now consensus in considering the disease as an aberrant adaptation to traumatic stress. Pharmacological research, aimed at the discovery of new potential effective treatments, has lately directed its attention towards the "so-called" cognitive enhancers. This class of substances, by modulating cognitive processes involved in the development and/or persistence of the post-traumatic symptomatology, could be of great help in improving the outcome of psychotherapies and patients' prognosis. In this perspective, drugs acting on the endocannabinoid system are receiving great attention due to their dual ability to modulate memory processes on one hand, and to reduce anxiety and depression on the other. The purpose of the present review is to offer a thorough overview of both animal and human studies investigating the effects of cannabinoids on memory processes. First, we will briefly describe the characteristics of the endocannabinoid system and the most commonly used animal models of learning and memory. Then, studies investigating cannabinoid modulatory influences on memory consolidation, retrieval and extinction will be separately presented, and the potential benefits associated with each approach will be discussed. In the final section, we will review literature data reporting beneficial effects of cannabinoid drugs in PTSD patients.},

  abstract    = {Extensive evidence indicates that the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) modulates the consolidation of memories for emotionally arousing experiences, an effect that involves the activation of the glucocorticoid system. Because the BLA expresses high densities of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, the present experiments investigated whether the endocannabinoid system in the BLA influences memory consolidation and whether glucocorticoids interact with this system. The CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (5-50 ng per 0.2 microL per side), infused bilaterally into the BLA of male Sprague-Dawley rats immediately after inhibitory avoidance training, induced dose-dependent enhancement of 48-h retention. Conversely, the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (0.07-0.28 ng per 0.2 microL per side) administered after training into the BLA induced inhibitory avoidance retention impairment. Furthermore, intra-BLA infusions of a low and nonimpairing dose of AM251 (0.14 ng per 0.2 microL per side) blocked the memory enhancement induced by concurrent administration of WIN55,212-2. Delayed infusions of WIN55,212-2 or AM251 administered into the BLA 3 h after training or immediate posttraining infusions of these drugs into the adjacent central amygdala did not significantly alter retention performance. Last, intra-BLA infusions of a low and otherwise nonimpairing dose of AM251 (0.14 ng per 0.2 microL per side) blocked the memory-enhancing effect induced by systemic administration of corticosterone (3 mg/kg, s.c.). These findings indicate that endocannabinoids in the BLA enhance memory consolidation and suggest that CB1 activity within this brain region is required for enabling glucocorticoid effects on memory consolidation enhancement.},

Here we show that infusion of CB1 receptor antagonist into the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) retarded cue-alone-induced reduction of fear-potentiated startle. Conversely, cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2 (WIN) facilitated the extinction. Unexpectedly, administration of WIN without cue-alone trials reduced startle potentiation in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of cannabinoid agonists was mimicked by endocannabinoid uptake or fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors. Rats were trained with 10 conditioned stimulus (CS(+)) (yellow light)-shock pairings. Extinction training with CS(+) (yellow light)-alone but not CS(-) (blue light)-alone trials decreased fear-potentiated startle. Intra-IL infusion of WIN before CS(-)-alone trials decreased startle potentiation, suggesting that the cannabinoid agonist decreased conditioned fear irrespective of whether the rats underwent CS(+)- or CS(-)-alone trials. Cannabinoid agonists activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in mPFC slices, and ERK inhibitor blocked the effect of cannabinoid agonists on fear-potentiated startle. These results suggest that CB1 receptors acting through the phosphorylation of ERK are involved not only in the extinction of conditioned fear but also in the adaptation to aversive situations in general.},

Here, using the converse behavioural states of fear extinction and its context-dependent renewal as a model in mice, we show that bi-directional transitions between states of high and low fear are triggered by a rapid switch in the balance of activity between two distinct populations of basal amygdala neurons. These two populations are integrated into discrete neuronal circuits differentially connected with the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Targeted and reversible neuronal inactivation of the basal amygdala prevents behavioural changes without affecting memory or expression of behaviour. Our findings indicate that switching between distinct behavioural states can be triggered by selective activation of specific neuronal circuits integrating sensory and contextual information. These observations provide a new framework for understanding context-dependent changes of fear behaviour.},

  abstract    = {The memory of fear extinction is context dependent: fear that is suppressed in one context readily renews in another. Understanding of the underlying neuronal circuits is, therefore, of considerable clinical relevance for anxiety disorders. Prefrontal cortical and hippocampal inputs to the amygdala have recently been shown to regulate the retrieval of fear memories, but the cellular organization of these projections remains unclear. By using anterograde tracing in a transgenic rat in which neurons express a dendritically-targeted PSD-95:Venus fusion protein under the control of a c-fos promoter, we found that, during the retrieval of extinction memory, the dominant input to active neurons in the lateral amygdala was from the infralimbic cortex, whereas the retrieval of fear memory was associated with greater hippocampal and prelimbic inputs. This pattern of retrieval-related afferent input was absent in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Our data show functional anatomy of neural circuits regulating fear and extinction, providing a framework for therapeutic manipulations of these circuits.},

  abstract    = {Congruent findings from studies of fear learning in animals and humans indicate that research on the circuits mediating fear constitutes our best hope of understanding human anxiety disorders. In mammals, repeated presentations of a conditioned stimulus that was previously paired to a noxious stimulus leads to the gradual disappearance of conditioned fear responses. Although much evidence suggests that this extinction process depends on plastic events in the amygdala, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Intercalated (ITC) amygdala neurons constitute probable mediators of extinction because they receive information about the conditioned stimulus from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and contribute inhibitory projections to the central nucleus (CEA), the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses. Thus, after extinction training, ITC cells could reduce the impact of conditioned-stimulus-related BLA inputs to the CEA by means of feed-forward inhibition. Here we test the hypothesis that ITC neurons mediate extinction by lesioning them with a toxin that selectively targets cells expressing micro-opioid receptors (microORs). Electron microscopic observations revealed that the incidence of microOR-immunoreactive synapses is much higher in ITC cell clusters than in the BLA or CEA and that microORs typically have a post-synaptic location in ITC cells. In keeping with this, bilateral infusions of the microOR agonist dermorphin conjugated to the toxin saporin in the vicinity of ITC neurons caused a 34\% reduction in the number of ITC cells but no significant cell loss in surrounding nuclei. Moreover, ITC lesions caused a marked deficit in the expression of extinction that correlated negatively with the number of surviving ITC neurons but not CEA cells. Because ITC cells exhibit an unusual pattern of receptor expression, these findings open new avenues for the treatment of anxiety disorders.},

  abstract    = {The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has a pivotal role in different cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Recent evidence confirm the involvement of the hippocampal CB1 receptors in the modulation of both memory extinction and reconsolidation processes in different brain areas, but few studies focused on the infralimbic cortex, another important cognitive area. Here, we infused the cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 either into the infralimbic cortex (IL) or the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus (HPC) of adult male Wistar rats immediately after a short (3min) reactivation session, known to labilize a previously consolidated memory trace in order to allow its reconsolidation with some modification. In both structures, the treatment was able to disrupt reconsolidation in a relatively long lasting way, reducing the freezing response. To our notice, this is the first demonstration of ECS involvement in reconsolidation in the Infralimbic Cortex. Despite poorly discriminative between CB1 and CB2 receptors, CP55,940 is a potent agent, and these results suggest that a similar CB1-dependent circuitry is at work both in HPC and in the IL during memory reconsolidation.},

  abstract    = {A major goal in current neuroscience is to understand the causal links connecting protein functions, neural activity, and behavior. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor is expressed in different neuronal subpopulations, and is engaged in fine-tuning excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Studies using conditional knock-out mice revealed necessary roles of CB1 receptor expressed in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons in synaptic plasticity and behavior, but whether this expression is also sufficient for brain functions is still to be determined. We applied a genetic strategy to reconstitute full wild-type CB1 receptor functions exclusively in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons and investigated endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic processes and behavior. Using this approach, we partly restored the phenotype of global CB1 receptor deletion in anxiety-like behaviors and fully restored hippocampus-dependent neuroprotection from chemically induced epileptiform seizures. These features coincided with a rescued hippocampal depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), a CB1 receptor-dependent form of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic neurons. By comparison, the rescue of the CB1 receptor on dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons prolonged the time course of DSE in the amygdala, and impaired fear extinction in auditory fear conditioning. These data reveal that CB1 receptor in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic neurons plays a sufficient role to control neuronal functions that are in large part hippocampus-dependent, while it is insufficient for proper amygdala functions, suggesting an unexpectedly complex circuit regulation by endocannabinoid signaling in the amygdala. Our data pave the way to a better understanding of neuronal networks in the context of behavior, by fine-tuned interference with synaptic transmission processes.},

Promising advances are being translated from basic science to the clinic, including approaches to distinguish risk versus resilience before trauma exposure, methods to interfere with fear development during memory consolidation after a trauma, and techniques to inhibit fear reconsolidation and to enhance extinction of chronic fear. It is hoped that this new knowledge will translate to more successful, neuroscientifically informed and rationally designed approaches to disorders of fear regulation.},

By simultaneously recording multiple local field potential signals across the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained to perform an instructed-delay reaching task, we found that these oscillations propagated as waves across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex. Moreover, we found that information about the visual target to be reached was encoded in terms of both latency and amplitude of evoked waves at a time when the field phase-locked with respect to the target onset. These findings suggest that high-frequency oscillations may subserve intra- and inter-cortical information transfer during movement preparation and execution.},

Theta sequences are thought to be organized by co-occurring gamma rhythms (∼25-100 Hz). However, how sequences of locations are represented during distinct slow (∼25-55 Hz) and fast (∼60-100 Hz) gamma subtypes remains poorly understood. We found that slow gamma-associated theta sequences activated on a compressed timescale and represented relatively long paths extending ahead of the current location. Fast gamma-associated theta sequences more closely followed an animal's actual location in real time. When slow gamma occurred, sequences of locations were represented across successive slow gamma phases. Conversely, fast gamma phase coding of spatial sequences was not observed. These findings suggest that slow gamma promotes activation of temporally compressed representations of upcoming trajectories, whereas fast gamma supports coding of ongoing trajectories in real time.},

This finding suggests that different gamma frequencies simply allow for different timings of transitions across cell assemblies at varying running speeds, rather than serving unique functions. However, accumulating evidence supports the conclusion that slow (∼25-55 Hz) and fast (∼60-100 Hz) gamma are distinct network states with different functions. If slow and fast gamma constitute distinct network states, then it is possible that slow and fast gamma frequencies are differentially affected by running speed. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and found that slow and fast gamma frequencies change differently as a function of running speed in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3, and in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Fast gamma frequencies increased with increasing running speed in all three areas. Slow gamma frequencies changed significantly less across different speeds. Furthermore, at high running speeds, CA3 firing rates were low, and MEC firing rates were high, suggesting that CA1 transitions from CA3 inputs to MEC inputs as running speed increases. These results support the hypothesis that slow and fast gamma reflect functionally distinct states in the hippocampal network, with fast gamma driven by MEC at high running speeds and slow gamma driven by CA3 at low running speeds.},

Recent insights imply ways in which theta-gamma coupling may facilitate transfer of information throughout the entorhinal-hippocampal network. Activating gamma-modulated cell assemblies at a particular theta phase may allow the network to produce a more powerful output by ensuring that distributed cells fire closely in time.

Slow gamma power and phase locking of spikes increased during prospective coding; fast gamma power and phase locking increased during retrospective coding. Additionally, slow gamma spikes occurred earlier in place fields than fast gamma spikes, and cell ensembles retrieved upcoming positions during slow gamma and encoded past positions during fast gamma.

  abstract    = {Accumulating evidence points to cortical oscillations as a mechanism for mediating interactions among functionally specialized neurons in distributed brain circuits. A brain function that may use such interactions is declarative memory--that is, memory that can be consciously recalled, such as episodes and facts. Declarative memory is enabled by circuits in the entorhinal cortex that interface the hippocampus with the neocortex. During encoding and retrieval of declarative memories, entorhinal and hippocampal circuits are thought to interact via theta and gamma oscillations, which in awake rodents predominate frequency spectra in both regions. In favour of this idea, theta-gamma coupling has been observed between entorhinal cortex and hippocampus under steady-state conditions in well-trained rats; however, the relationship between interregional coupling and memory formation remains poorly understood. Here we show, by multisite recording at successive stages of associative learning, that the coherence of firing patterns in directly connected entorhinal-hippocampus circuits evolves as rats learn to use an odour cue to guide navigational behaviour, and that such coherence is invariably linked to the development of ensemble representations for unique trial outcomes in each area. Entorhinal-hippocampal coupling was observed specifically in the 20-40-hertz frequency band and specifically between the distal part of hippocampal area CA1 and the lateral part of entorhinal cortex, the subfields that receive the predominant olfactory input to the hippocampal region. Collectively, the results identify 20-40-hertz oscillations as a mechanism for synchronizing evolving representations in dispersed neural circuits during encoding and retrieval of olfactory-spatial associative memory.},

  abstract    = {The replay of previously stored memories during hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) is thought to support both memory retrieval and consolidation in distributed hippocampal-neocortical circuits. Replay events consist of precisely timed sequences of spikes from CA3 and CA1 neurons that are coordinated both within and across hemispheres. The mechanism of this coordination is not understood. Here, we show that during SWRs in both awake and quiescent states there are transient increases in slow gamma (20-50 Hz) power and synchrony across dorsal CA3 and CA1 networks of both hemispheres. These gamma oscillations entrain CA3 and CA1 spiking. Moreover, during awake SWRs, higher levels of slow gamma synchrony are predictive of higher quality replay of past experiences. Our results indicate that CA3-CA1 gamma synchronization is a central component of awake memory replay and suggest that transient gamma synchronization serves as a clocking mechanism to enable coordinated memory reactivation across the hippocampal network.},

During slow-wave sleep, temporal coordination of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and medial prefrontal cortex spindles may be an important component of the process by which memories become hippocampus-independent.

This work has pinpointed the amygdala as an important component of the system involved in the acquisition, storage, and expression of fear memory and has elucidated in detail how stimuli enter, travel through, and exit the amygdala. Some progress has also been made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie fear conditioning, and recent studies have also shown that the findings from experimental animals apply to the human brain. It is important to remember why this work on emotion succeeded where past efforts failed. It focused on a psychologically well-defined aspect of emotion, avoided vague and poorly defined concepts such as "affect," "hedonic tone," or "emotional feelings," and used a simple and straightforward experimental approach. With so much research being done in this area today, it is important that the mistakes of the past not be made again. It is also time to expand from this foundation into broader aspects of mind and behavior.},

Because of the introduction of new techniques and the continued use of traditional approaches, it is becoming clear that conditioned fear involves much more complex networks than initially believed, including coordinated interactions between multiple excitatory and inhibitory circuits within the amygdala.},

  abstract    = {The context in which fear memories are extinguished has important implications for treating human fear and anxiety disorders. Extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning is context specific; after extinction, fear responses are reduced only in the extinction context and remain elevated in every other context. Contextual modulation of spike firing in the amygdala is a putative mechanism for the context-specific expression of extinguished fear. To test this possibility, we conditioned rats to fear two auditory conditional stimuli (CSs) and then extinguished each CS in separate and distinct contexts. Thereafter, single-unit activity in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) and freezing behavior were recorded during tests in which each CS was presented in each extinction context. Hence, each CS was tested in its own extinction context and in the context of the other CS. Conditional freezing was context dependent; fear to an extinguished CS was low in its own extinction context and high in the other test context. Similarly, the majority of LA neurons exhibited context-dependent spike firing; short-latency spike firing was greater to both CSs when they were presented outside of their own extinction context. In contrast, behavioral and neuronal responses to either non-extinguished CSs or habituated auditory stimuli were not contextually modulated. Context-dependent neuronal activity in the LA may be an important mechanism for disambiguating the meaning of fear signals, thereby enabling appropriate behavioral responses to such stimuli.},

In the present experiments, we examined the role of the dorsal hippocampus in the acquisition of extinction. After pairing an auditory conditional stimulus (CS) with an aversive footshock [unconditional stimulus (US)], rats received an extinction session in which the CS was presented without the US. In experiment 1, infusion of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, into the dorsal hippocampus before the extinction training session decreased the rate of extinction. Moreover, when later tested for fear to the extinguished CS, all rats that had received hippocampal inactivation before extinction training demonstrated renewed fear regardless of the context in which testing took place. This suggests a role for the dorsal hippocampus in both acquiring the extinction memory and encoding the CS-context relationship that yields the context dependence of extinction. In experiment 2, inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus before testing also disrupted the context dependence of fear to the extinguished CS. In experiment 3, quantitative autoradiography revealed the boundaries of muscimol diffusion after infusion into the dorsal hippocampus. Together, these results reveal that the dorsal hippocampus is involved in the acquisition, contextual encoding, and context-dependent retrieval of fear extinction. Learning and remembering when and where aversive events occur is essential for adaptive emotional regulation.},

The scope of this study is to explore the potential role of the hippocampal endocannabinoid system on reconsolidation and extinction processes. Bilateral infusion of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist, N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251) into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus of Wistar rats after memory reactivation facilitated the reconsolidation of the contextual fear conditioning memory. The inhibition of protein synthesis with DRB in the same brain region blocked memory reconsolidation. Both effects were persistent, lasting up to 7 days after the first retrieval experience. In contrast, the local infusion of anandamide blocked memory reconsolidation, an effect that was antagonized by the combined administration of anandamide with a subthreshold dose of a CB1 antagonist, supporting a CB1-mediated role of the hippocampal endocannabinoid system in the modulation of the memory reconsolidation. Local infusion of AM251 into CA1 blocked memory extinction whereas the administration of anandamide facilitated it; however, when combined with a subthreshold concentration of the CB1 antagonist, anandamide did not affect the extinction process. The clear-cut, opposite effects observed in each situation suggest a possible role of the hippocampal endocannabinoid system as a switching mechanism deciding which processes will take place, either maintaining the original memory (reconsolidation) or promoting a new learning (extinction).},

LTP has been studied most extensively in the hippocampus, but the relation between hippocampal LTP and memory has been difficult to establish. Here we explore the relation between LTP and memory in fear conditioning, an amygdala-dependent form of learning in which an innocuous conditioned stimulus (CS) elicits fear responses after being associatively paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). We have previously shown that LTP induction in pathways that transmit auditory CS information to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) increases auditory-evoked field potentials in this nucleus. Now we show that fear conditioning alters auditory CS-evoked responses in LA in the same way as LTP induction. The changes parallel the acquisition of CS-elicited fear behaviour, are enduring, and do not occur if the CS and US remain unpaired. LTP-like associative processes thus occur during fear conditioning, and these may underlie the long-term associative plasticity that constitutes memory of the conditioning experience.},

  abstract    = {Recently, it was reported that stimulation of the infralimbic cortex produces a feedforward inhibition of central amygdala neurons. The interest of this observation comes from the fact that the central nucleus is the main output station of the amygdala for conditioned fear responses and evidence that the infralimbic cortex plays a critical role in the extinction of conditioned fear. However, the identity of the neurons mediating this infralimbic-evoked inhibition of the central nucleus remains unknown. Likely candidates are intercalated amygdala neurons. Indeed, these cells receive glutamatergic afferents from the infralimbic cortex, use GABA as a transmitter, and project to the central amygdala. Thus, the present study was undertaken to test whether, in adult rats, the infralimbic cortex can affect the activity of intercalated neurons. To this end, disinhibition of the infralimbic cortex was induced by local infusion of the non-competitive GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Subsequently, neuronal activation was determined bilaterally within the amygdala using induction of the immediate early gene Fos. Infralimbic disinhibition produced a significant increase in the number of Fos-immunoreactive intercalated cells bilaterally whereas no change was detected in the central nucleus. In the basolateral amygdaloid complex, increases in the number of Fos-immunoreactive cells only reached significance in the contralateral lateral nucleus. These results suggest that glutamatergic inputs from the infralimbic cortex directly activate intercalated neurons. Thus, our findings raise the possibility that the infralimbic cortex inhibits conditioned fear via the excitation of intercalated cells and the consequent inhibition of central amygdala neurons.},

  abstract    = {Auditory fear memory is thought to be maintained by fear conditioning-induced potentiation of synaptic efficacy, which involves enhanced expression of surface AMPA receptor (AMPAR) at excitatory synapses in the lateral amygdala (LA). Depotentiation, reversal of conditioning-induced potentiation, has been proposed as a cellular mechanism for fear extinction; however, a direct link between depotentiation and extinction has not yet been tested. To address this issue, we applied both ex vivo and in vivo approaches to rats in which fear memory had been consolidated. A unique form of depotentiation reversed conditioning-induced potentiation at thalamic input synapses onto the LA (T-LA synapses) ex vivo. Extinction returned the enhanced T-LA synaptic efficacy observed in conditioned rats to baseline and occluded the depotentiation. Consistently, extinction reversed conditioning-induced enhancement of surface expression of AMPAR subunits in LA synaptosomal preparations. A GluR2-derived peptide that blocks regulated AMPAR endocytosis inhibited depotentiation, and microinjection of a cell-permeable form of the peptide into the LA attenuated extinction. Our results are consistent with the use of depotentiation to weaken potentiated synaptic inputs onto the LA during extinction and provide strong evidence that AMPAR removal at excitatory synapses in the LA underlies extinction.},

  abstract    = {Conditioned fear responses to a tone previously paired with a shock diminish if the tone is repeatedly presented without the shock, a process known as extinction. Since Pavlov it has been hypothesized that extinction does not erase conditioning, but forms a new memory. Destruction of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which consists of infralimbic and prelimbic cortices, blocks recall of fear extinction, indicating that medial prefrontal cortex might store long-term extinction memory. Here we show that infralimbic neurons recorded during fear conditioning and extinction fire to the tone only when rats are recalling extinction on the following day. Rats that froze the least showed the greatest increase in infralimbic tone responses. We also show that conditioned tones paired with brief electrical stimulation of infralimbic cortex elicit low freezing in rats that had not been extinguished. Thus, stimulation resembling extinction-induced infralimbic tone responses is able to simulate extinction memory. We suggest that consolidation of extinction learning potentiates infralimbic activity, which inhibits fear during subsequent encounters with fear stimuli.},

Moreover, we found that GRP receptor (GRPR) is expressed in GABAergic interneurons of the lateral nucleus. GRP excites these interneurons and increases their inhibition of principal neurons. GRPR-deficient mice showed decreased inhibition of principal neurons by the interneurons, enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), and greater and more persistent long-term fear memory. By contrast, these mice performed normally in hippocampus-dependent Morris maze. These experiments provide genetic evidence that GRP and its neural circuitry operate as a negative feedback regulating fear and establish a causal relationship between Grpr gene expression, LTP, and amygdala-dependent memory for fear.},

  abstract    = {Susceptibility to common human diseases is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The explosive growth of genetic data, and the knowledge that it is generating, are transforming our biological understanding of these diseases. In this review, we describe the technological and analytical advances that have enabled genome-wide association studies to be successful in identifying a large number of genetic variants robustly associated with common disease. We examine the biological insights that these genetic associations are beginning to produce, from functional mechanisms involving individual genes to biological pathways linking associated genes, and the identification of functional annotations, some of which are cell-type-specific, enriched in disease associations. Although most efforts have focused on identifying and interpreting genetic variants that are irrefutably associated with disease, it is increasingly clear that--even at large sample sizes--these represent only the tip of the iceberg of genetic signal, motivating polygenic analyses that consider the effects of genetic variants throughout the genome, including modest effects that are not individually statistically significant. As data from an increasingly large number of diseases and traits are analysed, pleiotropic effects (defined as genetic loci affecting multiple phenotypes) can help integrate our biological understanding. Looking forward, the next generation of population-scale data resources, linking genomic information with health outcomes, will lead to another step-change in our ability to understand, and treat, common diseases.},

We start by giving a number of quotes from scientists and journalists about perceived problems with GWASs. We will then briefly give the history of GWASs and focus on the discoveries made through this experimental design, what those discoveries tell us and do not tell us about the genetics and biology of complex traits, and what immediate utility has come out of these studies. Rather than giving an exhaustive review of all reported findings for all diseases and other complex traits, we focus on the results for auto-immune diseases and metabolic diseases.

  abstract    = {Enormous progress in mapping complex traits in humans has been made in the last 5 yr. There has been early success for prevalent diseases with complex phenotypes. These studies have demonstrated clearly that, while complex traits differ in their underlying genetic architectures, for many common disorders the predominant pattern is that of many loci, individually with small effects on phenotype. For some traits, loci of large effect have been identified. For almost all complex traits studied in humans, the sum of the identified genetic effects comprises only a portion, generally less than half, of the estimated trait heritability. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain why this might be the case, including untested rare variants, and gene-gene and gene-environment interaction. Effort is currently being directed toward implementation of novel analytic approaches and testing rare variants for association with complex traits using imputed variants from the publicly available 1000 Genomes Project resequencing data and from direct resequencing of clinical samples. Through integration with annotations and functional genomic data as well as by in vitro and in vivo experimentation, mapping studies continue to characterize functional variants associated with complex traits and address fundamental issues such as epistasis and pleiotropy. This review focuses primarily on the ways in which genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revolutionized the field of human quantitative genetics.},

  abstract    = {The distribution of neurons contributing to the fornix was mapped by placing the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in polyacrylamide gels in different medial to lateral locations within the fornix of three rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). The HRP was placed from 3 to 5 mm caudal to the descending columns of the fornix. Additional information came from a series of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasciculata) with anterograde tracer injections in the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampal formation, including the subiculum and presubiculum, together with the entorhinal cortex (EC) and perirhinal cortex (area 35) contribute numerous axons to the fornix in a topographical manner. In contrast, the lateral perirhinal cortex (area 36) and parahippocampal cortical areas TF and TH only contained a handful of cells labeled via the fornix. The medial fornix originates from cells in the caudal half of the subiculum, the lamina principalis interna of the caudal half of the presubiculum, and from the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The intermediate portion of the fornix (i.e., that part midway between the midline and most lateral parts of the fornix) originates from cells in the rostral half of the subiculum and prosubiculum, the anterior presubiculum (only from the lamina principalis externa), the caudal presubiculum (primarily from lamina principalis interna), the rostral half of CA3, the EC (primarily 28I and 28M), and the perirhinal cortex (area 35). The lateral parts of the fornix arise from the rostral EC (28L only) and the most rostral portion of CA3. Subcortically, the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, supramammillary nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the thalamic nucleus reuniens all send projections through the fornix, which presumably terminate in the hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal region. These results not only help to define those regions that project via the fornix, but also reveal those subcortical projections to the hippocampal formation most likely to rely entirely on nonfornical pathways.},

  abstract    = {Over the past four decades, a "standard framework" has emerged to explain the neural mechanisms of episodic memory storage. This framework has been instrumental in driving hippocampal research forward and now dominates the design and interpretation of experimental and theoretical studies. It postulates that cortical inputs drive plasticity in the recurrent cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) synapses to rapidly imprint memories as attractor states in CA3. Here we review a range of experimental studies and argue that the evidence against the standard framework is mounting, notwithstanding the considerable evidence in its support. We propose CRISP as an alternative theory to the standard framework. CRISP is based on Context Reset by dentate gyrus (DG), Intrinsic Sequences in CA3, and Pattern completion in cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). Compared to previous models, CRISP uses a radically different mechanism for storing episodic memories in the hippocampus. Neural sequences are intrinsic to CA3, and inputs are mapped onto these intrinsic sequences through synaptic plasticity in the feedforward projections of the hippocampus. Hence, CRISP does not require plasticity in the recurrent CA3 synapses during the storage process. Like in other theories DG and CA1 play supporting roles, however, their function in CRISP have distinct implications. For instance, CA1 performs pattern completion in the absence of CA3 and DG contributes to episodic memory retrieval, increasing the speed, precision, and robustness of retrieval. We propose the conceptual theory, discuss its implications for experimental results and suggest testable predictions. It appears that CRISP not only accounts for those experimental results that are consistent with the standard framework, but also for results that are at odds with the standard framework. We therefore suggest that CRISP is a viable, and perhaps superior, theory for the hippocampal function in episodic memory.},

The notion of episodic memory was first proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature.},

These new techniques allow us to focus on the input region of the neuron and highlight the excitable properties of the dendritic membrane. Interestingly, some of the recent experimental findings were anticipated by earlier theoretical research, for example, the observation that some spines possess excitable channels that might generate local all-or-none events. Computer models were used previously to explore the conditions for initiating an action potential at the dendritic tree, in particular, at the spine head, and for active propagation between excitable spines and excitable dendritic arbors. The consequences for synaptic amplification, for the extent of active spread in the tree and for non-linear discriminations between different patterns of synaptic inputs were also considered. Here we review the biophysical insights gained from the theory and demonstrate how these elucidate the recent experimental results.},

We also examined the effects of CB1 receptor agonists on Ca2+-independent miniature IPSCs (mIPSC). Both agonists were without significant effect on the frequency or amplitude of mIPSCs. Synchronous gamma oscillations induced by kainic acid in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices were reversibly reduced in amplitude by the CB1 receptor agonist CP 55,940, which is consistent with an action on IPSCs. We used CB1-/- knock-out mice to confirm the specificity of the antibody and of the agonist (WIN55,212-2) action.

  abstract    = {One of the features of both adult-onset and developmental forms of amnesia resulting from bilateral medial temporal lobe damage, or even from relatively selective damage to the hippocampus, is the sparing of working memory. Recently, however, a number of studies have reported deficits on working memory tasks in patients with damage to the hippocampus and in macaque monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions. These studies suggest that successful performance on working memory tasks with high memory load require the contribution of the hippocampus. Here we compared performance on a working memory task (the Self-ordered Pointing Task), between patients with early onset hippocampal damage and a group of healthy controls. Consistent with the findings in the monkeys with neonatal lesions, we found that the patients were impaired on the task, but only on blocks of trials with intermediate memory load. Importantly, only intermediate to high memory load blocks yielded significant correlations between task performance and hippocampal volume. Additionally, we found no evidence of proactive interference in either group, and no evidence of an effect of time since injury on performance. We discuss the role of the hippocampus and its interactions with the prefrontal cortex in serving working memory.},

  abstract    = {Working memory (WM) maintenance is assumed to rely on a single sustained process throughout the entire maintenance period. This assumption, although fundamental, has never been tested. We used intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the human hippocampus in two independent experiments to investigate the neural dynamics underlying WM maintenance. We observed periodic fluctuations between two different oscillatory regimes: Periods of "memory activation" were reflected by load-dependent alpha power reductions and lower levels of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). They occurred interleaved with periods characterized by load-independent high levels of alpha power and CFC. During memory activation periods, a relevant CFC parameter (load-dependent changes of the peak modulated frequency) correlated with individual WM capacity. Fluctuations between these two periods predicted successful performance and were locked to the phase of endogenous delta oscillations. These results show that hippocampal maintenance is a dynamic rather than constant process and depends critically on a hierarchy of oscillations.},

  abstract    = {The theta-gamma neural coding theory suggests that multiple items are represented in working memory (WM) by a superposition of gamma cycles on theta oscillations. To enable a stable, non-interfering representation of multiple items, such a theta-gamma neural code may be reflected by phase-phase coupling, i.e., a precise locking of gamma subcycles to specific theta phases. Recent data have indicated that the hippocampus critically contributes to multi-item working memory. Therefore, we investigated phase-phase coupling patterns in the hippocampus based on intracranial EEG recordings in presurgical epilepsy patients performing a variant of the serial Sternberg WM task. In accordance with predictions of the theta-gamma coding theory, we observed increased phase-phase coupling between theta and beta/gamma activity during working memory maintenance compared to inter-trial intervals. These phase-phase coupling patterns were apparent during maintenance of two and four items, but not during maintenance of a single item, where prominent lower coupling ratios occurred. Furthermore, we observed that load-dependent changes of coupling factors correlated with individual WM capacities. Our data demonstrate that multi-item WM is associated with changes in hippocampal phase-phase coupling between theta and beta/gamma activity.},

  abstract    = {A general consensus is emerging that the hippocampus has an important and active role in the creation of new long-term memory representations of associations or bindings between elements. However, it is less clear whether this contribution can be extended to the creation of temporary bound representations in working memory, involving the retention of small numbers of items over short delays. We examined this by administering a series of recognition and recall tests of working memory for colour-location binding and object-location binding to a patient with highly selective hippocampal damage (Jon), and groups of control participants. Jon achieved high levels of accuracy in all working memory tests of recognition and recall binding across retention intervals of up to 10s. In contrast, Jon performed at chance on an unexpected delayed test of the same object-location binding information. These findings indicate a clear dissociation between working memory and long-term memory, with no evidence for a critical hippocampal contribution to item-location binding in working memory.},

A number of recent studies have indicated that the hippocampus may also play a critical role in working memory and perception, but these results have been highly controversial because other similar studies have failed to find evidence for hippocampal involvement. Thus, the precise role that the hippocampus plays in cognition is still debated. In the current paper, I propose that the hippocampus supports the generation and utilization of complex high-resolution bindings that link together the qualitative aspects that make up an event; these bindings are essential for recollection, and they can also contribute to performance across a variety of tasks including perception and working memory. An examination of the existing patient literature provides support for this proposal by showing that hippocampal damage leads to impairments on perception and working memory tasks that require complex high-resolution bindings. Conversely, hippocampal damage is much less likely to lead to impairments on tasks that require only low-resolution or simple associations/relations. The current proposal can be distinguished from earlier accounts of hippocampal function, and it generates a number of novel predictions that can be tested in future studies.},

  abstract    = {The brain basis for auditory working memory, the process of actively maintaining sounds in memory over short periods of time, is controversial. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants, we demonstrate that the maintenance of single tones in memory is associated with activation in auditory cortex. In addition, sustained activation was observed in hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that patterns of activity in auditory cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus distinguished the tone that was maintained in memory. Functional connectivity during maintenance was demonstrated between auditory cortex and both the hippocampus and inferior frontal cortex. The data support a system for auditory working memory based on the maintenance of sound-specific representations in auditory cortex by projections from higher-order areas, including the hippocampus and frontal cortex.In this work, we demonstrate a system for maintaining sound in working memory based on activity in auditory cortex, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, and functional connectivity among them. Specifically, our work makes three advances from the previous work. First, we robustly demonstrate hippocampal involvement in all phases of auditory working memory (encoding, maintenance, and retrieval): the role of hippocampus in working memory is controversial. Second, using a pattern classification technique, we show that activity in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus is specific to the maintained tones in working memory. Third, we show long-range connectivity of auditory cortex to hippocampus and frontal cortex, which may be responsible for keeping such representations active during working memory maintenance.},

  abstract    = {Working memory allows information from transient events to persist as active neural representations that can be used for goal-directed behaviors such as decision making and learning. Computational modeling based on neuronal firing patterns in animals suggests that one putative mechanism enabling working memory is periodic reactivation (henceforth termed "replay") of the maintained information coordinated by neural oscillations at theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency. To investigate this possibility, we trained multivariate pattern classifier decoding algorithms on oscillatory brain responses to images depicting natural scenes, recorded with high temporal resolution via magnetoencephalography. These classifiers were applied to brain activity recorded during the subsequent five second maintenance of the scenes. This decoding revealed replay during the entire maintenance interval. Replay was specific to whether an indoor or an outdoor scene was maintained and whether maintenance centered on configural associations of scene elements or just single scene elements. Replay was coordinated by the phase of theta and the amount of theta coordination was correlated with working memory performance. By confirming the predictions of a mechanistic model and linking these to behavioral performance in humans, these findings identify theta-coupled replay as a mechanism of working memory maintenance.},

  abstract    = {Neural ensembles were recorded from the CA3 region of rats running on T-based decision tasks. Examination of neural representations of space at fast time scales revealed a transient but repeatable phenomenon as rats made a decision: the location reconstructed from the neural ensemble swept forward, first down one path and then the other. Estimated representations were coherent and preferentially swept ahead of the animal rather than behind the animal, implying it represented future possibilities rather than recently traveled paths. Similar phenomena occurred at other important decisions (such as in recovery from an error). Local field potentials from these sites contained pronounced theta and gamma frequencies, but no sharp wave frequencies. Forward-shifted spatial representations were influenced by task demands and experience. These data suggest that the hippocampus does not represent space as a passive computation, but rather that hippocampal spatial processing is an active process likely regulated by cognitive mechanisms.},

In particular, several recent studies have demonstrated that enhanced synchronous activity within and among medial temporal lobe structures is correlated with increased memory performance in humans and animals. Modulations in rhythmic synchronization in the gamma-frequency (30-100 Hz) and theta-frequency (4-8 Hz) bands have been related to memory performance, and interesting relationships have been described between these oscillations that suggest a mechanism for inter-areal coupling. Neuronal synchronization has also been linked to spike timing-dependent plasticity, a cellular mechanism thought to underlie learning and memory. The available evidence suggests that neuronal synchronization modulates memory performance as well as potential cellular mechanisms of memory storage.},

We found that the mutual influence among neuronal groups depends on the phase relation between rhythmic activities within the groups. Phase relations supporting interactions between the groups preceded those interactions by a few milliseconds, consistent with a mechanistic role. These effects were specific in time, frequency, and space, and we therefore propose that the pattern of synchronization flexibly determines the pattern of neuronal interactions.},

Longitudinal modeling (fixed-effects analysis, cross-lagged path analysis) was used to examine whether the association between changes in cannabis use and risk of relapse over time is the result of shared vulnerability between psychosis and cannabis use, psychosis increasing the risk of cannabis use (reverse causation), or a causal effect of cannabis use on psychosis relapse.Exposure to cannabis within the first and second years after onset of psychosis.The main outcome measure was relapse of psychosis, defined as subsequent hospitalization for psychosis. Effect of cannabis use status in the first year (Ct1) and second year (Ct2) and pattern of cannabis use continuation in the first year and second year were modeled for risk of relapse in the first year (Rt1) and risk of relapse in the second year (Rt2) after psychosis onset.A total of 220 patients with first-episode psychosis were included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 28.62 [8.58] years; age range, 18-65 years; 90 women [40.9\%] and 130 men [59.1\%]). Fixed-effects models that adjusted for time-variant (other illicit drug use, antipsychotic medication adherence) and time-invariant (eg, genetic or premorbid environment) unobserved confounders revealed that there was an increase in the odds of experiencing a relapse of psychosis during periods of cannabis use relative to periods of no use (odds ratio, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.24). Change in the pattern of continuation significantly increased the risk (odds ratio, 1.07; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.13), suggesting a dose-dependent association. Cross-lagged analysis confirmed that this association reflected an effect of cannabis use on subsequent risk of relapse (Ct1→Rt2: β = 0.44, P = .04) rather than an effect of relapse on subsequent cannabis use (Rt1→Ct2: β = -0.29, P = .59).These results reveal a dose-dependent association between change in cannabis use and relapse of psychosis that is unlikely to be a result of self-medication or genetic and environmental confounding.},

  abstract    = {The constellation of major phenomena associated with schizophrenia (e.g., postpubertal onset, congenital hippocampal area damage, cortical functional deficits, limbic dopamine (DA) dysregulation, and vulnerability to stress) have been difficult to explain with a unitary animal model. Although it has been shown that rats develop increased mesolimbic DA transmission and reduced cortical DA turnover following adult excitotoxic lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH), the implications of early developmental VH lesions are not known. To determine the developmental sequelae of such changes, we produced ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral hippocampal formation in rats on the 7th day after birth (PD7). Motor activity in a novel environment, after saline injection and after d-amphetamine administration were similar in control and lesioned rats at PD35. However, in early adulthood, at PD56, animals with the hippocampal lesion were hyperactive in each of these conditions. The emergence of the hyperactivity at PD56 could be prevented by pretreatment with haloperidol. Moreover, rats lesioned as neonates, in contrast to a similar lesion induced in adult animals, were also hyperresponsive to stress evaluated with a swim test. This latter effect is analogous to that seen after adult lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex, rather than after adult lesions of VH, suggesting that the neonatal VH lesion may affect functional development of the medial prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate that in rats with neonatally induced excitotoxic VH lesions, behavioral indices consistent with increased mesolimbic DA responsivity to stressful and to pharmacologic stimuli emerge only in early adulthood. Homologous mechanisms may underlie certain aspects of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {Medications to treat cognitive disorders are increasingly needed, yet researchers have had few successes in this challenging arena. Cognitive abilities in primates arise from highly evolved N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor circuits in layer III of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These circuits have unique modulatory needs that can differ from the layer V neurons that predominate in rodents, but they offer multiple therapeutic targets. Cognitive improvement often requires low doses that enhance the pattern of information held in working memory, whereas higher doses can produce nonspecific changes that obscure information. Identifying appropriate doses for clinical trials may be helped by assessments in monkeys and by flexible, individualized dose designs. The use of guanfacine (Intuniv) for prefrontal cortical disorders was based on research in monkeys, supporting this approach. Coupling our knowledge of higher primate circuits with the powerful methods now available in drug design will help create effective treatments for cognitive disorders.},

Although intravenous ketamine infusions can lift mood within hours, the current review describes how intranasal ketamine administration can have ultra-rapid antidepressant effects, beginning within minutes (5-40 minutes) and lasting hours, but with repeated treatments needed for sustained antidepressant actions. Research in rodents suggests that increased synaptogenesis in PFC may contribute to the prolonged benefit of ketamine administration, beginning hours after administration. However, these data cannot explain the relief that occurs within minutes of intranasal ketamine delivery. We hypothesize that the ultra-rapid effects of intranasal administration in humans may be due to ketamine blocking the NMDAR circuits that generate the emotional representations of pain (eg, Brodmann Areas 24 and 25, insular cortex), cortical areas that can be overactive in depression and which sit above the nasal epithelium. In contrast, NMDAR blockade in the dorsolateral PFC following systemic administration of ketamine may contribute to cognitive deficits. This novel view may help to explain how intravenous ketamine can treat the symptoms of depression yet worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia.},

  abstract    = {There is substantial evidence from studies in humans and animal models for a role of the endocannabinoid system in the control of emotional states. Several studies have shown an association between exposure to trauma and substance use. Specifically, it has been shown that there is increased prevalence of cannabis use in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients and vice versa. Clinical studies suggest that PTSD patients may cope with their symptoms by using cannabis. This treatment-seeking strategy may explain the high prevalence of cannabis use among individuals with PTSD. Preliminary studies in humans also suggest that treatment with cannabinoids may decrease PTSD symptoms including sleep quality, frequency of nightmares, and hyperarousal. However, there are no large-scale, randomized, controlled studies investigating this specifically. Studies in animal models have shown that cannabinoids can prevent the effects of stress on emotional function and memory processes, facilitate fear extinction, and have an anti-anxiety-like effect in a variety of tasks. Moreover, cannabinoids administered shortly after exposure to a traumatic event were found to prevent the development of PTSD-like phenotype. In this article, we review the existing literature on the use of cannabinoids for treating and preventing PTSD in humans and animal models. There is a need for large-scale clinical trials examining the potential decrease in PTSD symptomatology with the use of cannabis. In animal models, there is a need for a better understanding of the mechanism of action and efficacy of cannabis. Nevertheless, the end result of the current clinical and preclinical data is that cannabinoid agents may offer therapeutic benefits for PTSD.},

In the competitive binding studies, all the CB1 receptor agonists investigated had significantly very high affinity for the active R* state recognized by [(3)H]CP55,940 and lower affinity for the inactive R state mainly recognized by [(3)H]SR141716A in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP [Gpp(NH)p]. In contrast, various CB1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists had similar nanomolar affinities at both [(3)H]CP55,940 and [(3)H]SR141716A recognized binding states. These results clearly characterize the significant differences between the active R* and inactive R binding states of CB1 receptors in naive rat and dog brain. In addition, these results also demonstrates that the CB1 agonists and antagonists/inverse agonists can be differentiated by their relative affinities at active (R*) and inactive (R) binding states of the CB1 receptor.},

  abstract    = {Prevalence of cannabis use among military populations vary. There is evidence that drug use is associated with combat exposure and PTSD. The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of cannabis use among Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) personnel and to identify any relationship with cannabis use and combat exposure.This cross sectional study was carried out among representative samples of SLN Special Forces (Special Boat Squadron) and regular forces deployed in combat areas. Both Special Forces and regular forces were selected using simple random sampling. Personnel who had served continuously in combat areas during the 1 year period prior to end of combat operations were included in the study. Cannabis use was defined as smoking cannabis at least once during the past 12 months.The sample consisted of 259 Special Forces and 412 regular navy personnel. Prevalence of cannabis use was 5.22\% (95\% CI 3.53-6.9). There was no significant difference in prevalence of cannabis use among Special Forces personnel compared to regular forces. Cannabis use was significantly higher in the age group 18-24 years [OR 4.42 (95\% CI 2.18-8.97)], personnel who were never married [OR 2.02 (95\% CI 0.99-4.12)], or had an educational level less than GCE O'Level [OR 4.02 (95\% CI 1.17-13.78)]. There was significant association between cannabis use and hazardous alcohol use [adjusted OR 5.47 (95\% CI 2.65-11.28)], PTSD [adjusted OR 4.20 (95\% CI 1.08-16.38)], GHQ caseness [adjusted OR 2.83 (95\% CI 1.18-6.79)] and multiple somatic complaints [adjusted OR 3.61 (95\% CI 1.5-8.7)]. Cannabis use was not associated with smoking. Risk of cannabis use was less in those who had seen dead or wounded [adjusted OR 0.42 (95\% CI 0.20-0.85)]. Experiencing hostility from civilians was the only combat exposure that significantly increased the risk of cannabis use [adjusted OR 4.06 (95\% CI 1.06-15.56)].Among Sri Lanka Navy personnel exposed to combat cannabis use was significantly associated with hazardous alcohol use but not smoking. PTSD and other adverse mental health outcomes were associated with an increased risk of cannabis use. Exposure to combat was not associated with increased risk of cannabis use.},

  abstract    = {The use of cannabis for medical purposes is proliferating in the U.S., and PTSD is an explicitly approved condition for accessing medical cannabis in 5 states. Prior research suggests that people with PTSD often use cannabis to help cope with their condition, and that doing so results in more frequent and problematic cannabis use patterns. Specific coping motivations, such as sleep improvement, among medical cannabis users, have not been examined.The present study evaluated specific coping use motivations, frequency of cannabis and alcohol use, and mental health among a convenience sample of patients (N=170) at a medical cannabis dispensary in California.Those with high PTSD scores were more likely to use cannabis to improve sleep, and for coping reasons more generally, compared with those with low PTSD scores. Cannabis use frequency was greater among those with high PTSD scores who used for sleep promoting purposes compared with those with low PTSD scores or those who did not use for sleep promoting purposes.Consistent with prior research, this study found increased rates of coping-oriented use of cannabis and greater frequency of cannabis use among medical users with high PTSD scores compared with low PTSD scores. In addition, sleep improvement appears to be a primary motivator for coping-oriented use. Additional research is needed to examine the health consequences of this pattern of cannabis use and whether alternative sleep promoting interventions (e.g. CBT-I) could reduce the reliance on cannabis for adequate sleep among those with PTSD.},

Participants were 61 marijuana-using adolescents (M(age)=15.81) who reported experiencing lifetime exposure to at least one traumatic event. Consistent with predictions, past two-week posttraumatic stress symptoms significantly predicted coping motives for marijuana use and were not associated with social, enhancement, or conformity motives for use.

The current study examined associations between trauma (i.e., lifetime trauma exposure and PTSD) and cannabis phenotypes (i.e., lifetime cannabis use and CUD) in a nationally representative sample. Participants were individuals who participated in Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 34,396; 52.4\% women; age, M = 48.0 years, SD = 16.9). Lifetime DSM-IV Criterion A trauma exposure was significantly associated with lifetime cannabis use (OR = 1.215) but was only marginally associated with CUD (OR = 0.997). Within the trauma-exposed sample, lifetime PTSD showed a significant association with CUD (OR = 1.217) but was only marginally associated with lifetime cannabis use (OR = 0.992). Partially consistent with hypotheses, lifetime trauma was associated with greater odds of lifetime cannabis use, whereas PTSD was associated with greater odds of CUD. Longitudinal research investigating patterns of onset of these events/disorders is needed.},

Within these regions, beta/gamma phase-synchronization supports the integration of sensory functions, while synchronization in theta/alpha bands supports the regulation of attentional functions. A key challenge is to understand which mechanisms integrate neuronal processing across these distinct frequencies and thereby the sensory and attentional functions. We investigated whether such integration could be achieved by cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). Using concurrent magneto- and electroencephalography, we found that CFS was load-dependently enhanced between theta and alpha-gamma and between alpha and beta/gamma oscillations during VWM maintenance among visual, FP, and dorsal attention (DA) systems. CFS also connected the hubs of within-frequency-synchronized networks and its strength predicted individual VWM capacity. We propose that CFS integrates processing among synchronized neuronal networks from theta to gamma frequencies to link sensory and attentional functions.},

Moreover, existing computational models dealing with biomarkers typically only examine one possible mechanism in isolation, disregarding the possibility that other combinations of model parameters might produce the same network behavior (what has been termed "multifactoriality"). In this study we describe a step toward a computational instantiation of an endophenotypic finding for schizophrenia, namely the impairment of evoked auditory gamma and beta oscillations in schizophrenia. We explore the multifactorial nature of this impairment using an established model of primary auditory cortex, by performing an extensive search of the parameter space. We find that single network parameters contain only little information about whether the network will show impaired gamma entrainment and that different regions in the parameter space yield similar network level oscillation abnormalities. These regions in the parameter space, however, show strong differences in the underlying network dynamics. To sum up, we present a first step toward an in silico instantiation of an important biomarker of schizophrenia, which has great potential for the identification and study of disease mechanisms and for understanding of existing treatments and development of novel ones.},

  abstract    = {The search for biological causes of mental disorders has up to now met with limited success, leading to growing dissatisfaction with diagnostic classifications. However, it is questionable whether most clinical syndromes should be expected to correspond to specific microscale brain alterations, as multiple low-level causes could lead to similar symptoms in different individuals. In order to evaluate the potential multifactoriality of alterations related to psychiatric illness, we performed a parametric exploration of published computational models of schizophrenia. By varying multiple parameters simultaneously, such as receptor conductances, connectivity patterns, and background excitation, we generated 5625 different versions of an attractor-based network model of schizophrenia symptoms. Among networks presenting activity within valid ranges, 154 parameter combinations out of 3002 (5.1\%) presented a phenotype reminiscent of schizophrenia symptoms as defined in the original publication. We repeated this analysis in a model of schizophrenia-related deficits in spatial working memory, building 3125 different networks, and found that 41 (4.9\%) out of 834 networks with valid activity presented schizophrenia-like alterations. In isolation, none of the parameters in either model showed adequate sensitivity or specificity to identify schizophrenia-like networks. Thus, in computational models of schizophrenia, even simple network phenotypes related to the disorder can be produced by a myriad of causes at the molecular and circuit levels. This suggests that unified explanations for either the full syndrome or its behavioral and network endophenotypes are unlikely to be expected at the genetic and molecular levels.},

Past efforts to determine effective connectivity mostly relied on model based approaches such as Granger causality or dynamic causal modeling. Transfer entropy (TE) is an alternative measure of effective connectivity based on information theory. TE does not require a model of the interaction and is inherently non-linear. We investigated the applicability of TE as a metric in a test for effective connectivity to electrophysiological data based on simulations and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in a simple motor task. In particular, we demonstrate that TE improved the detectability of effective connectivity for non-linear interactions, and for sensor level MEG signals where linear methods are hampered by signal-cross-talk due to volume conduction.},

  abstract    = {The symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involve impairments in prefrontal cortical top-down regulation of attention and behavior. All current pharmacological treatments for ADHD facilitate catecholamine transmission, and basic research suggests that these compounds have prominent actions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The dorsolateral PFC is especially sensitive to levels of norepinephrine and dopamine, whereby either too little or too much markedly impairs PFC function. Recent physiological studies have shown that norepinephrine strengthens PFC network connectivity and maintains persistent firing during a working memory task through stimulation of postsynaptic α(2A)-adrenoceptors on PFC neurons. Conversely, dopamine acts at D1 receptors to narrow spatial tuning, sculpting network inputs to decrease noise (i.e., stabilization of the representation). The stimulant medications and atomoxetine appear to enhance PFC function by indirectly increasing these catecholamine actions through blockade of norepinephrine and/or dopamine transporters. In contrast, guanfacine mimics the enhancing effects of norepinephrine at postsynaptic α(2A)-receptors in the PFC, strengthening network connectivity. Stronger PFC regulation of attention, behavior, and emotion likely contributes to the therapeutic effects of these medications for the treatment of ADHD.},

  abstract    = {The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), a key modulator of synaptic transmission in mammalian brain, is produced in dendritic spines and then crosses the synaptic junction to depress neurotransmitter release. Here we report that 2-AG-dependent retrograde signaling also mediates an enduring enhancement of glutamate release, as assessed with independent tests, in the lateral perforant path (LPP), one of two cortical inputs to the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Induction of this form of long-term potentiation (LTP) involved two types of glutamate receptors, changes in postsynaptic calcium, and the postsynaptic enzyme that synthesizes 2-AG. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy confirmed that CB1 cannabinoid receptors are localized presynaptically to LPP terminals, while the inhibition or knockout of the receptors eliminated LPP-LTP. Suppressing the enzyme that degrades 2-AG dramatically enhanced LPP potentiation, while overexpressing it produced the opposite effect. Priming with a CB1 agonist markedly reduced the threshold for LTP. Latrunculin A, which prevents actin polymerization, blocked LPP-LTP when applied extracellularly but had no effect when infused postsynaptically into granule cells, indicating that critical actin remodeling resides in the presynaptic compartment. Importantly, there was no evidence for the LPP form of potentiation in the Schaffer-commissural innervation of field CA1 or in the medial perforant path. Peripheral injections of compounds that block or enhance LPP-LTP had corresponding effects on the formation of long-term memory for cues conveyed to the dentate gyrus by the LPP. Together, these results indicate that the encoding of information carried by a principal hippocampal afferent involves an unusual, regionally differentiated form of plasticity.},

  abstract    = {Delay-period activity of prefrontal cortical cells, the neural hallmark of working memory, is generally assumed to be sustained by reverberating synaptic excitation in the prefrontal cortical circuit. Previous model studies of working memory emphasized the high efficacy of recurrent synapses, but did not investigate the role of temporal synaptic dynamics. In this theoretical work, I show that biophysical properties of cortical synaptic transmission are important to the generation and stabilization of a network persistent state. This is especially the case when negative feedback mechanisms (such as spike-frequency adaptation, feedback shunting inhibition, and short-term depression of recurrent excitatory synapses) are included so that the neural firing rates are controlled within a physiological range (10-50 Hz), in spite of the exuberant recurrent excitation. Moreover, it is found that, to achieve a stable persistent state, recurrent excitatory synapses must be dominated by a slow component. If neuronal firings are asynchronous, the synaptic decay time constant needs to be comparable to that of the negative feedback; whereas in the case of partially synchronous dynamics, it needs to be comparable to a typical interspike interval (or oscillation period). Slow synaptic current kinetics also leads to the saturation of synaptic drive at high firing frequencies that contributes to rate control in a persistent state. For these reasons the slow NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission is likely required for sustaining persistent network activity at low firing rates. This result suggests a critical role of the NMDA receptor channels in normal working memory function of the prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract    = {γ oscillations, which can be identified by rhythmic electrical signals ∼30-100 Hz, consist of interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons that result in rhythmic inhibition capable of entraining firing within local cortical circuits. Many possible mechanisms have been described through which γ oscillations could act on cortical circuits to modulate their responses to input, alter their patterns of activity, and/or enhance the efficacy of their outputs onto downstream targets. Recently, several studies have observed changes in behavior after optogenetically manipulating neocortical γ oscillations. Now, future studies should determine whether these manipulations elicit physiological correlates associated with specific mechanisms through which γ oscillations are hypothesized to modulate cortical circuit function. There are numerous such mechanisms, so identifying which ones are actually engaged by optogenetic manipulations known to affect behavior would help flesh out exactly how γ oscillations contribute to cortical circuit function under normal and/or pathological conditions.},

In addition, the participation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the γ rhythm varies across local circuits and conditions, particularly in the cortex. Although these dynamics present a challenge to interpreting the functional role of γ oscillations, these patterns of activity emerge from synaptic interactions among excitatory and inhibitory neurons and thus provide important insight into local circuit operations.},

Over the last decade and a half, diagnostics for the latter have come to be dominated by the transfer entropy. Via straightforward examples, we show that it and a derivative quantity, the causation entropy, do not, in fact, quantify the flow of information. At one and the same time they can overestimate flow or underestimate influence. We isolate why this is the case and propose several avenues to alternate measures for information flow. We also address an auxiliary consequence: The proliferation of networks as a now-common theoretical model for large-scale systems, in concert with the use of transferlike entropies, has shoehorned dyadic relationships into our structural interpretation of the organization and behavior of complex systems. This interpretation thus fails to include the effects of polyadic dependencies. The net result is that much of the sophisticated organization of complex systems may go undetected.},

During the first three inpatient days, placebo marijuana was available for self-administration (withdrawal). For the next 4 days, active marijuana was available for self-administration (relapse). Participants paid for self-administered marijuana using study earnings. Self-administration, mood, task performance, food intake, and sleep were measured.THC reversed the anorexia and weight loss associated with marijuana withdrawal, and decreased a subset of withdrawal symptoms, but increased sleep onset latency, and did not decrease marijuana relapse. Lofexidine was sedating, worsened abstinence-related anorexia, and did not robustly attenuate withdrawal, but improved sleep and decreased marijuana relapse. The combination of lofexidine and THC produced the most robust improvements in sleep and decreased marijuana withdrawal, craving, and relapse in daily marijuana smokers relative to either medication alone.These data suggest the combination of lofexidine and THC warrant further testing as a potential treatment for marijuana dependence.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia is associated with severe cognitive deficits, including impaired working memory (WM). A neural mechanism that may contribute to WM impairment is the disruption in excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance in cortical microcircuits. It remains unknown, however, how these alterations map onto quantifiable behavioral deficits in patients. Based on predictions from a validated microcircuit model of spatial WM, we hypothesized two key behavioral consequences: i) increased variability of WM traces over time, reducing performance precision; and ii) decreased ability to filter out distractors that overlap with WM representations. To test model predictions, we studied N=27 schizophrenia patients and N=28 matched healthy comparison subjects (HCS) who performed a spatial WM task designed to test the computational model. Specifically, we manipulated delay duration and distractor distance presented during the delay. Subjects used a high-sensitivity joystick to indicate the remembered location, yielding a continuous response measure. Results largely followed model predictions, whereby patients exhibited increased variance and less WM precision as the delay period increased relative to HCS. Schizophrenia patients also exhibited increased WM distractibility, with reports biased toward distractors at specific spatial locations, as predicted by the model. Finally, the magnitude of the WM drift and distractibility were significantly correlated, indicating a possibly shared underlying mechanism. Effects are consistent with elevated E/I ratio in schizophrenia, establishing a framework for translating neural circuit computational model of cognition to human experiments, explicitly testing mechanistic behavioral hypotheses of cellular-level neural deficits in patients.},

  abstract    = {Schizophrenia patients exhibit dysfunctional gamma oscillations in response to simple auditory stimuli or more complex cognitive tasks, a phenomenon explained by reduced NMDA transmission within inhibitory/excitatory cortical networks. Indeed, a simple steady-state auditory click stimulation paradigm at gamma frequency (~40 Hz) has been reproducibly shown to reduce entrainment as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) in patients. However, some investigators have reported increased phase locking factor (PLF) and power in response to 40 Hz auditory stimulus in patients. Interestingly, preclinical literature also reflects this contradiction. We investigated whether a graded deficiency in NMDA transmission can account for such disparate findings by administering subanesthetic ketamine (1-30 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle to conscious rats (n=12) and testing their EEG entrainment to 40 Hz click stimuli at various time points (~7-62 min after treatment). In separate cohorts, we examined in vivo NMDA channel occupancy and tissue exposure to contextualize ketamine effects. We report a robust inverse relationship between PLF and NMDA occupancy 7 min after dosing. Moreover, ketamine could produce inhibition or disinhibition of the 40 Hz response in a temporally dynamic manner. These results provide for the first time empirical data to understand how cortical NMDA transmission deficit may lead to opposite modulation of the auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Importantly, our findings posit that 40 Hz ASSR is a pharmacodynamic biomarker for cortical NMDA function that is also robustly translatable. Besides schizophrenia, such a functional biomarker may be of value to neuropsychiatric disorders like bipolar and autism spectrum where 40 Hz ASSR deficits have been documented.},

  abstract    = {Goal-directed behavior is often impaired by interference from the external environment, either in the form of distraction by irrelevant information that one attempts to ignore, or by interrupting information that demands attention as part of another (secondary) task goal. Both forms of external interference have been shown to detrimentally impact the ability to maintain information in working memory (WM). Emerging evidence suggests that these different types of external interference exert different effects on behavior and may be mediated by distinct neural mechanisms. Better characterizing the distinct neuro-behavioral impact of irrelevant distractions versus attended interruptions is essential for advancing an understanding of top-down attention, resolution of external interference, and how these abilities become degraded in healthy aging and in neuropsychiatric conditions. This manuscript describes a novel cognitive paradigm developed the Gazzaley lab that has now been modified into several distinct versions used to elucidate behavioral and neural correlates of interference, by to-be-ignored distractors versus to-be-attended interruptors. Details are provided on variants of this paradigm for investigating interference in visual and auditory modalities, at multiple levels of stimulus complexity, and with experimental timing optimized for electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In addition, data from younger and older adult participants obtained using this paradigm is reviewed and discussed in the context of its relationship with the broader literatures on external interference and age-related neuro-behavioral changes in resolving interference in working memory.},

  abstract    = {Many studies have validated consumer-facing hardware platforms as efficient, cost-effective, and accessible data collection instruments. However, there are few reports that have assessed the reliability of these platforms as assessment tools compared with traditional data collection platforms. Here we evaluated performance on a spatial attention paradigm obtained by our standard in-lab data collection platform, the personal computer (PC), and compared performance with that of two widely adopted, consumer technology devices: the Apple (Cupertino, CA) iPad(®) 2 and Microsoft (Redmond, WA) Xbox(®) Kinect(®). The task assessed spatial attention, a fundamental ability that we use to navigate the complex sensory input we face daily in order to effectively engage in goal-directed activities. Participants were presented with a central spatial cue indicating where on the screen a stimulus would appear. We manipulated spatial cueing such that, on a given trial, the cue presented one of four levels of information indicating the upcoming target location. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that as information of the cued spatial area decreased (i.e., larger area of possible target location) there would be a parametric decrease in performance, as revealed by slower response times and lower accuracies. Identical paradigm parameters were used for each of the three platforms, and testing was performed in a single session with a counterbalanced design. We found that performance on the Kinect and iPad showed a stronger parametric effect across the cued-information levels than that on the PC. Our results suggest that not only can the Kinect and iPad be reliably used as assessment tools to yield research-quality behavioral data, but that these platforms exploit mechanics that could be useful in building more interactive, and therefore effective, cognitive assessment and training designs. We include a discussion on the possible contributing factors to the differential effects between platforms, as well as potential confounds of the study.},

Our results demonstrated that only a single brain region, the superior parietal lobule (SPL), exhibited a significant relationship with multitasking performance, such that increased activation in the multitasking condition versus the singletasking condition was associated with higher task performance (i.e., least multitasking cost). Together, these results support previous research indicating that parietal regions underlie multitasking abilities and that performance costs are related to a bottleneck in control processes involving the SPL that serves to divide attention between two tasks.},

  abstract    = {Older adults experience deficits in working memory (WM) that are acutely exacerbated by the presence of distracting information. Human neurophysiological studies have revealed that these changes are accompanied by a diminished ability to suppress visual cortical activity associated with task-irrelevant information. Although this is often attributed to deficits in top-down control from a prefrontal cortical source, this has not yet been directly demonstrated. Here we evaluate the neural basis of distraction's negative impact on WM and the impairment in neural suppression in older adults by performing structural and functional MRIs while older participants engage in tasks that require remembering relevant visual stimuli in the context of overlapping irrelevant stimuli. Analysis supports both an age-related distraction effect and neural suppression deficit, and extends our understanding by revealing an alteration in functional connectivity between visual cortices and a region in the default network, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, within the older population, the magnitude of WM distractibility and neural suppression are both associated with individual differences in cortical volume and activity of the mPFC, as well as its associated white-matter tracts.},

To investigate this under-explored nexus, we used an imagery monitoring task to investigate the subjective aspects of WM performance. Specifically, in two experiments, we examined the effects on consciousness of (a) holding in mind information having a low versus high memory load, and (b) holding memoranda in mind during the presentation of distractors (e.g., visual stimuli associated with a response incompatible with that of the memoranda). Higher rates of rehearsal (conscious imagery) occurred in the high load and distractor conditions than in comparable control conditions. Examination of the temporal properties of the rehearsal-based imagery revealed that, across subjects, imagery events occurred evenly throughout the delay. We hope that future variants of this new imagery monitoring task will reveal additional insights about WM, consciousness, and action control.},

Here we assessed age-related impacts by intrasensory WM interference from lower-level stimulus features such as visual and auditory motion stimuli. We consistently found that interference in the form of ignored distractions and secondary task interruptions presented during a WM maintenance period, degraded memory accuracy in both the visual and auditory domain. However, in contrast to prior studies assessing WM for visual object stimuli, feature-based interference effects were not observed to be significantly greater in older adults. Analyses of neural oscillations in the alpha frequency band further revealed preserved mechanisms of interference processing in terms of post-stimulus alpha suppression, which was observed maximally for secondary task interruptions in visual and auditory modalities in both younger and older adults. These results suggest that age-related sensitivity of WM to interference may be limited to complex object stimuli, at least at low WM loads.},

  abstract    = {An act as simple as flicking a switch involves various stages of processing. Each stage is susceptible to interference from competing representations/processes. Interference at different stages of processing (e.g., perceptual stages versus response selection stages) leads to distinct behavioral, neural, and subjective effects. In the flanker task, for instance, one responds to a visual target and disregards flanking 'distractors.' Theoretically-predicted interference (increased response times, error rates, and subjective 'urges to err') is stronger when distractors and targets are associated with different actions (response interference) than when they look different but are associated with the same action (perceptual interference). Extant versions of the task tax working memory (WM) minimally, but many everyday actions (e.g., searching for keys or holding one's breath) require more WM-based control. To illuminate this uncharted area, we examined the nature of interference in delayed action tasks, which rely on WM. We found that systematic interference arises even when action-related representations are, not triggered solely by external stimuli, but actively held in WM. We discuss these findings with increased emphasis on the under-explored subjective effects of different kinds of interference. The implications of these findings for the study of action production, WM, and conscious processing are entertained.},

Attention allows for selective processing of goal-relevant information and rejecting task-irrelevant information. Working memory functions to maintain goal-relevant information in memory for brief periods of time for subsequent recall and/or manipulation. Efficient attention and working memory thus support the best extraction and retention of environmental information for optimal task performance. Recent studies have evidenced that attention and working memory abilities can be enhanced by cognitive training games as well as entertainment videogames. Here we review key cognitive paradigms that have been used to evaluate the impact of game-based training on various aspects of attention and working memory. Common use of such methodology within the scientific community will enable direct comparison of the efficacy of different games across age groups and clinical populations. The availability of common assessment tools will ultimately facilitate development of the most effective forms of game-based training for cognitive rehabilitation and education.},

The core features include activity modulation in stimulus-selective sensory cortices with concurrent engagement of prefrontal and parietal control regions that function as sources of top-down signals. Notably, top-down modulation is engaged during both stimulus-present and stimulus-absent stages of WM tasks; that is, expectation of an ensuing stimulus to be remembered, selection and encoding of stimuli, maintenance of relevant information in mind and memory retrieval.},

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to guide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalographic recordings in humans, we perturbed PFC function at the inferior frontal junction in participants before they performed a selective-attention, delayed-recognition task. This resulted in diminished top-down modulation of activity in posterior cortex during early encoding stages, which predicted a subsequent decrement in working memory accuracy. Participants with stronger fronto-posterior functional connectivity displayed greater disruptive effects. Our data further suggests that broad alpha-band (7-14 Hz) phase coherence subserved this long-distance top-down modulation. These results suggest that top-down modulation mediated by the prefrontal cortex is a causal link between early attentional processes and subsequent memory performance.},

Though such effects have been demonstrated in single cells, there are no studies that examine how such mechanisms may lead to the effects of dopamine at a neural network level. With this motivation, we investigated the effects of dopamine on synchronization in a simulated neural network composed of excitatory and fast-spiking inhibitory Wang-Buzsaki neurons. The effects of dopamine were implemented through varying leak K+ conductance of the fast-spiking interneurons and the network synchronization within the gamma band (∼40 Hz) was analyzed. Parametrically varying the leak K+ conductance revealed an inverted-U shaped relationship, with low gamma band power at both low and high conductance levels and optimal synchronization at intermediate conductance levels. We also examined the effects of modulating excitability of the inhibitory neurons more generically using an idealized model with theta neurons, with similar findings. Moreover, such a relationship holds when the external input is both tonic and periodic. Our computational results mirror our empirical study of dopamine modulation in schizophrenia and healthy controls, which showed that amphetamine administration increased gamma power in patients but decreased it in controls. Together, our computational and empirical investigations indicate that dopamine can modulate cortical gamma band synchrony in an inverted-U fashion and that the physiologic effects of dopamine on single fast-spiking interneurons can give rise to such non-monotonic effects at the network level.},

  abstract    = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

It has been suggested that most of the inconsistencies could be reconciled invoking an indirect interaction with the M-type K(+) current, another current involved in epilepsy. However, here we show that the original experiments, and the simplified model used to explain and support them, cannot explain in a conclusive way the puzzling I(h) actions observed in different experimental preparations. Using a realistic model, we show instead how and why a shunting current, such as that carried by TASK-like channels, and dependent on I(h) channel is able to explain virtually all experimental findings on I(h) up- or down-regulation by modulators or pathological conditions. The model results suggest several experimentally testable predictions to characterize in more details this elusive and peculiar interaction, which may be of fundamental importance in the development of new treatments for all those pathological and cognitive dysfunctions caused, mediated, or affected by I(h).},

Coactivation of a few 10s to 100s of neurons can code sensory inputs and behavioral task performance within psychophysical limits. However, in a sea of sensory inputs and demand for complex motor outputs how is the activity of such small subpopulations of neurons organized? Two theories dominate in this respect: increases in spike rate (rate coding) and sharpening of the coincidence of spiking in active neurons (temporal coding). Both have computational advantages and are far from mutually exclusive. Here, we review evidence for a bias in neuronal circuits toward temporal coding and the coexistence of rate and temporal coding during population rhythm generation. The coincident expression of multiple types of gamma rhythm in sensory cortex suggests a mechanistic substrate for combining rate and temporal codes on the basis of stimulus strength.},

We focus on a previously published computational model of hippocampal activity that shows the gamma rhythms nesting in the theta rhythms, and investigate the dynamical mechanisms underlying that interaction. There are three types of neurons in the model: pyramidal cells, fast-spiking interneurons, and "oriens lacunosum-moelculare" (O-LM cells); the latter is an inhibitory cell whose inhibition has a longer time scale, and which has currents associated with intrinsic theta-rhythm behavior. We identify two main modes of interaction among the slow and the fast rhythms in the model, modulated by the strength of the excitatory synapse on the O-LM cells. Using resets of phases after each pyramidal cell and O-LM spike, we extend the use of the phase transition map (PTM) to encode the stability type of spiking patterns in networks where different frequencies interact. The tailored application of the PTM to the model network measures how the interaction between the shape of the phase response curves and the length of the gamma period determines the number of gamma spikes in theta cycles, and provides an explicit formula for the length of theta intervals in nesting regimes. Using the PTM, we also explain the covariance of the gamma and theta rhythms as drive is changed over some intervals.},

  abstract    = {In networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with mutual synaptic coupling, specific drive to sub-ensembles of cells often leads to gamma-frequency (25-100 Hz) oscillations. When the number of driven cells is too small, however, the synaptic interactions may not be strong or homogeneous enough to support the mechanism underlying the rhythm. Using a combination of computational simulation and mathematical analysis, we study the breakdown of gamma rhythms as the driven ensembles become too small, or the synaptic interactions become too weak and heterogeneous. Heterogeneities in drives or synaptic strengths play an important role in the breakdown of the rhythms; nonetheless, we find that the analysis of homogeneous networks yields insight into the breakdown of rhythms in heterogeneous networks. In particular, if parameter values are such that in a homogeneous network, it takes several gamma cycles to converge to synchrony, then in a similar, but realistically heterogeneous network, synchrony breaks down altogether. This leads to the surprising conclusion that in a network with realistic heterogeneity, gamma rhythms based on the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory cell populations must arise either rapidly, or not at all. For given synaptic strengths and heterogeneities, there is a (soft) lower bound on the possible number of cells in an ensemble oscillating at gamma frequency, based simply on the requirement that synaptic interactions between the two cell populations be strong enough. This observation suggests explanations for recent experimental results concerning the modulation of gamma oscillations in macaque primary visual cortex by varying spatial stimulus size or attention level, and for our own experimental results, reported here, concerning the optogenetic modulation of gamma oscillations in kainate-activated hippocampal slices. We make specific predictions about the behavior of pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in these experiments.},

  abstract    = {Rhythmic activity in populations of cortical neurons accompanies, and may underlie, many aspects of primary sensory processing and short-term memory. Activity in the gamma band (30 Hz up to >100 Hz) is associated with such cognitive tasks and is thought to provide a substrate for temporal coupling of spatially separate regions of the brain. However, such coupling requires close matching of frequencies in co-active areas, and because the nominal gamma band is so spectrally broad, it may not constitute a single underlying process. Here we show that, for inhibition-based gamma rhythms in vitro in rat neocortical slices, mechanistically distinct local circuit generators exist in different laminae of rat primary auditory cortex. A persistent, 30-45 Hz, gap-junction-dependent gamma rhythm dominates rhythmic activity in supragranular layers 2/3, whereas a tonic depolarization-dependent, 50-80 Hz, pyramidal/interneuron gamma rhythm is expressed in granular layer 4 with strong glutamatergic excitation. As a consequence, altering the degree of excitation of the auditory cortex causes bifurcation in the gamma frequency spectrum and can effectively switch temporal control of layer 5 from supragranular to granular layers. Computational modeling predicts the pattern of interlaminar connections may help to stabilize this bifurcation. The data suggest that different strategies are used by primary auditory cortex to represent weak and strong inputs, with principal cell firing rate becoming increasingly important as excitation strength increases.},

  abstract    = {Spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) has been observed experimentally in vitro and is a widely studied neural algorithm for synaptic modification. While the functional role of STDP has been investigated extensively, the effect of rhythms on the precise timing of STDP has not been characterized as well. We use a simplified biophysical model of a cortical network that generates pyramidal interneuronal gamma rhythms (PING). Plasticity via STDP is investigated at the excitatory pyramidal cell synapse from a gamma frequency (30-90 Hz) input independent of the network gamma rhythm. The input may represent a corticocortical or an information-specific thalamocortical connection. This synapse is mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediated (NMDAR) currents. For distinct network and input frequencies, the model shows robust frequency regimes of potentiation and depression, providing a mechanism by which responses to certain inputs can potentiate while responses to other inputs depress. For potentiating regimes, the model suggests an optimal amount and duration of plasticity that can occur, which depends on the time course for the decay of the postsynaptic NMDAR current. Prolonging the duration of the input beyond this optimal time results in depression. Inserting pauses in the input can increase the total potentiation. The optimal pause length corresponds to the decay time of the NMDAR current. Thus, STDP in this model provides a mechanism for potentiation and depression depending on input frequency and suggests that the slow NMDAR current decay helps to regulate the optimal amplitude and duration of the plasticity. The optimal pause length is comparable to the time scale of the negative phase of a modulatory theta rhythm, which may pause gamma rhythm spiking. Our pause results may suggest a novel role for this theta rhythm in plasticity. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of auditory thalamocortical plasticity.},

Relationships between different frequencies correspond to mechanisms designed to minimise interference, couple activity via stable phase interactions, and control the amplitude of one frequency relative to the phase of another. These mechanisms are proposed to form a framework for spectral information processing. Individual local circuits can also transform their frequency through changes in intrinsic neuronal properties and interactions with other oscillating microcircuits. Here we discuss a frequency transformation in which activity in two co-active local circuits may combine sequentially to generate a third frequency whose period is the concatenation sum of the original two. With such an interaction, the intrinsic periodicity in each component local circuit is preserved - alternate, single periods of each original rhythm form one period of a new frequency - suggesting a robust mechanism for combining information processed on multiple concurrent spatiotemporal scales.},

However, the lack of methods for direct and cell-type-specific interference with inhibition has prevented better insights that help link synaptic and cellular properties with network function. Here, we generated genetically modified mice (PV-Deltagamma(2)) in which synaptic inhibition was ablated in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. Hippocampal local field potential and unit recordings in the CA1 area of freely behaving mice revealed that theta rhythm was strongly reduced in these mice. The characteristic coupling of theta and gamma oscillations was strongly altered in PV-Deltagamma(2) mice more than could be accounted for by the reduction in theta rhythm only. Surprisingly, gamma oscillations were not altered. These data indicate that synaptic inhibition onto PV+ interneurons is indispensable for theta- and its coupling to gamma oscillations but not for rhythmic gamma-activity in the hippocampus. Similar alterations in rhythmic activity were obtained in a computational hippocampal network model mimicking the genetic modification, suggesting that intrahippocampal networks might contribute to these effects.},

We propose that in attentional states fast-spiking interneurons may be subject to a bath of inhibition resulting from cholinergic activation of a second class of inhibitory interneurons, restoring conditions needed for gamma rhythmicity. Oscillations and coherence are emergent features, not assumptions, in our model. The gamma oscillations in turn support stimulus competition. The mechanism is a form of "oscillatory selection," in which neural interactions change phase relationships that regulate firing rates, and attention shapes those neural interactions.},

  abstract    = {The disorganized symptoms of schizophrenia, including severely disordered thought patterns, may be indicative of a problem with the construction and maintenance of cell assemblies during sensory processing and attention. The gamma and beta frequency bands (15-70 Hz) are believed relevant to such processing. This paper addresses the results of an experimental examination of the cortical response of 12 schizophrenia patients and 12 control subjects when presented with auditory click-train stimuli in the gamma/beta frequency band during measurement using magnetoencephalography (MEG), as well as earlier work by Kwon et al. These data indicate that control subjects show an increased 40-Hz response to both 20- and 40-Hz stimulation as compared with patients, whereas schizophrenic subjects show a preference for 20-Hz response to the same driving frequencies. In this work, two computational models of the auditory cortex are constructed based on postmortem studies that indicate cortical interneurons in schizophrenic subjects have decreased GAT-1 (a GABA transporter) and GAD(67) (1 of 2 enzymes responsible for GABA synthesis). The models transition from control to schizophrenic frequency response when an extended inhibitory decay time is introduced; this change captures a possible effect of these GABA alterations. Modeling gamma/beta range auditory entrainment in schizophrenia provides insight into how biophysical mechanisms can impact cognitive function. In addition, the study of dynamics that underlie auditory entrainment in schizophrenia may contribute to the understanding of how gamma and beta rhythms impact cognition in general.},

The functional differentiation along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is poorly demarcated in comparison with the transverse axis. Using patch clamp recordings in conjunction with post hoc anatomy, we have examined the pattern of connectivity and the functional differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus. Here, we provide anatomical and physiological evidence that the prominent rhythmic network activities of the hippocampus, the behavior-specific gamma and theta oscillations, are seen predominantly along the transverse and longitudinal axes respectively. This orthogonal relationship is the result of the axonal field trajectories and the consequential interaction of the principal cells and major interneuron subtypes involved in generating each rhythm. Thus, the axonal arborization patterns of hippocampal inhibitory cells may represent a structural framework for the spatiotemporal distribution of activity observed within the hippocampus.},

  abstract    = {Synchronous rhythmic spiking in neuronal networks can be brought about by the interaction between E-cells and Icells (excitatory and inhibitory cells). The I-cells gate and synchronize the E-cells, and the E-cells drive and synchronize the I-cells. We refer to rhythms generated in this way as PING (pyramidal-interneuronal gamma) rhythms. The PING mechanism requires that the drive I(I) to the I-cells be sufficiently low; the rhythm is lost when I(I) gets too large. This can happen in at least two ways. In the first mechanism, the I-cells spike in synchrony, but get ahead of the E-cells, spiking without being prompted by the E-cells. We call this phase walkthrough of the I-cells. In the second mechanism, the I-cells fail to synchronize, and their activity leads to complete suppression of the E-cells. Noisy spiking in the E-cells, generated by noisy external drive, adds excitatory drive to the I-cells and may lead to phase walkthrough. Noisy spiking in the I-cells adds inhibition to the E-cells and may lead to suppression of the E-cells. An analysis of the conditions under which noise leads to phase walkthrough of the I-cells or suppression of the E-cells shows that PING rhythms at frequencies far below the gamma range are robust to noise only if network parameter values are tuned very carefully. Together with an argument explaining why the PING mechanism does not work far above the gamma range in the presence of heterogeneity, this justifies the "G" in "PING."},

  abstract    = {Understanding the mechanistic bases of neuronal synchronization is a current challenge in quantitative neuroscience. We studied this problem in two putative cellular pacemakers of the mammalian hippocampal theta rhythm: glutamatergic stellate cells (SCs) of the medial entorhinal cortex and GABAergic oriens-lacunosum-molecular (O-LM) interneurons of hippocampal region CA1. We used two experimental methods. First, we measured changes in spike timing induced by artificial synaptic inputs applied to individual neurons. We then measured responses of free-running hybrid neuronal networks, consisting of biological neurons coupled (via dynamic clamp) to biological or virtual counterparts. Results from the single-cell experiments predicted network behaviors well and are compatible with previous model-based predictions of how specific membrane mechanisms give rise to empirically measured synchronization behavior. Both cell types phase lock stably when connected via homogeneous excitatory-excitatory (E-E) or inhibitory-inhibitory (I-I) connections. Phase-locked firing is consistently synchronous for either cell type with E-E connections and nearly anti-synchronous with I-I connections. With heterogeneous connections (e.g., excitatory-inhibitory, as might be expected if members of a given population had heterogeneous connections involving intermediate interneurons), networks often settled into phase locking that was either stable or unstable, depending on the order of firing of the two cells in the hybrid network. Our results imply that excitatory SCs, but not inhibitory O-LM interneurons, are capable of synchronizing in phase via monosynaptic mutual connections of the biologically appropriate polarity. Results are largely independent of synaptic strength and synaptic kinetics, implying that our conclusions are robust and largely unaffected by synaptic plasticity.},

In this article, we analyze the effects of neuromodulation on ionic conductances in an oscillating cortical circuit model. The model consists of synaptically-coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons and supports rhythmic activity in the alpha, beta, and gamma ranges. We find that the effects of neuromodulation on ionic conductances are, by themselves, sufficient to induce transitions between synchronous gamma and beta rhythms and asynchronous alpha rhythms. Moreover, these changes are consistent with changes in behavioral state, with the rhythm transitioning from the slower alpha to the faster gamma and beta as arousal increases. We also observe that it is the same set of underlying intrinsic and network mechanisms that appear to be simultaneously responsible for both the observed transitions between the rhythm types and between their synchronization properties. Spike time response curves (STRCs) are used to study the relationship between the transitions in rhythm and the underlying biophysics.},

In the gamma rhythm, pyramidal cells fire together with the interneurons, while in the beta rhythm, pyramidal cells fire on a subset of cycles of the interneurons. It is shown that gamma and beta rhythms have different properties with respect to creation of cell assemblies. In the presence of heterogeneous inputs to the pyramidal cells, the gamma rhythm creates an assembly of firing pyramidal cells from cells whose drive exceeds a threshold. During the gamma to beta transition, a slow outward potassium current is activated, and as a result the cell assembly vanishes. The slow currents make each of the pyramidal cells fire with a beta rhythm, but the field potential of the network still displays a gamma rhythm. Hebbian changes of connections among the pyramidal cells give rise to a beta rhythm, and the cell assemblies are recovered with a temporal separation between cells firing in different cycles. We present experimental evidence showing that such a separation can occur in hippocampal slices.},

This frequency range covers the EEG bands beta 1 (12-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz). The pharmacological profile of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked EEG potentials reveals a very strong influence on these rhythms by drugs which have direct effects on GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (general anaesthetics, sedative/hypnotics) or indirect effects on inhibitory neuronal function (opiates, ketamine). In addition, a number of experimental models of, in particular, gamma-frequency oscillations, have revealed both common denominators for oscillation generation and function, and subtle differences in network dynamics between the different frequency ranges. Powerful computer and mathematical modelling techniques based around both clinical and experimental observations have recently provided invaluable insight into the behaviour of large networks of interconnected neurons. In particular, the mechanistic profile of oscillations generated as an emergent property of such networks, and the mathematical derivation of this complex phenomenon have much to contribute to our understanding of how and why neurons oscillate. This review will provide the reader with a brief outline of the basic properties of inhibition-based oscillations in the CNS by combining research from laboratory models, large-scale neuronal network simulations, and mathematical analysis.},

Here we analyze the mechanisms by which timing in the spike doublet can affect the synchronization process. The analysis describes two independent effects: one comes from the timing of excitation from separated local circuits to an inhibitory cell, and the other comes from the timing of inhibition from separated local circuits to an excitatory cell. We show that a network with both of these effects has different synchronization properties than a network with either excitatory or inhibitory type of coupling alone, and we give a rationale for the shorter space scales associated with inhibitory interactions.},

Using numerical and analytical techniques, we show here that the electrical and inhibitory coupling play different roles in the synchronization of rhythms in inhibitory networks. The parameter range chosen is motivated by gamma rhythms, in which the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)-mediated inhibition is relatively strong. Under this condition, addition of a small electrical conductance can increase the degree of synchronization far more than a much larger increase in inhibitory conductance. The inhibitory synapses act to eliminate the effects of different initial conditions, whereas the electrical synapses mitigate suppression of firing due to heterogeneity in the network. Analytical techniques include tracking trajectories of coupled cells between spikes; the analysis shows that, in networks in which the degree of excitability is heterogeneous, inhibition can increase the dispersion of the voltages between spikes, whereas electrical coupling reduces such dispersion.},

  abstract      = {There has been debate regarding whether Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Complex PTSD) is distinct from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) when the latter is comorbid with PTSD.To determine whether the patterns of symptoms endorsed by women seeking treatment for childhood abuse form classes that are consistent with diagnostic criteria for PTSD, Complex PTSD, and BPD.A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted on an archival dataset of 280 women with histories of childhood abuse assessed for enrollment in a clinical trial for PTSD.THE LCA REVEALED FOUR DISTINCT CLASSES OF INDIVIDUALS: a Low Symptom class characterized by low endorsements on all symptoms; a PTSD class characterized by elevated symptoms of PTSD but low endorsement of symptoms that define the Complex PTSD and BPD diagnoses; a Complex PTSD class characterized by elevated symptoms of PTSD and self-organization symptoms that defined the Complex PTSD diagnosis but low on the symptoms of BPD; and a BPD class characterized by symptoms of BPD. Four BPD symptoms were found to greatly increase the odds of being in the BPD compared to the Complex PTSD class: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable sense of self, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, and impulsiveness.Findings supported the construct validity of Complex PTSD as distinguishable from BPD. Key symptoms that distinguished between the disorders were identified, which may aid in differential diagnosis and treatment planning.},
