After 60 min, only fully kindled rats showed a long-lasting potentiation, also visible up to 24 h later, as compared to controls or nonkindled animals.

Every 2nd day, evoked potentials were recorded from the hilus following stimulation of the PP with single 0.1 ms pulses at 6 current intensities. Changes in synaptic excitability of the dentate granule cells were monitored by measuring the amplitudes of the population spikes; changes in the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission were monitored by measuring the slopes of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Control rats, which were not given kindling stimulation, were tested for changes in synaptic transmission and excitability in the same way, at comparable times. In general, hilar stimulation resulted in a large decrease in population spike amplitudes to below baseline and control levels, accompanied by a paradoxical potentiation of EPSPs. Population spike amplitudes decreased more in rats that developed generalized stage-5 seizures (Generalized group) than in rats that did not progress beyond partial seizures despite 60 days of stimulation (Partial group). Conversely, EPSP slopes increased more in the Partial group than in the Generalized group. These results suggest that kindling stimulation may potentiate responsiveness of the directly activated dentate granule cells to inputs from the PP, but at the same time suppress the output of the granule cells resulting from this input. Furthermore, the results indicate that kindling is more closely allied to the suppression of output than to the potentiation of responsiveness to input.",

Yet, latency from the thalamus to a cortical cell is remarkably constant across the cortex (typically, approximately 2 ms). Here, we found a mechanism that produces invariability of latency among thalamocortical afferents, irrespective of the variability of travelling distances. The conduction velocity (CV) was calculated from excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from layer IV cells in mouse thalamocortical slices by stimulating the ventrobasal nucleus of the thalamus (VB) and white matter (WM). In adults, the obtained CV for VB to WM (CV(VB-WM); 3.28 +/- 0.11 ms) was approximately 10 times faster than that of WM to layer IV cells (CV(WM-IV); 0.33 +/- 0.05 ms). The CV(VB-WM) was confirmed by recording antidromic single-unit responses from VB cells by stimulating WM. Exclusion of synaptic delay from CV(WM-IV) did not account for the 10-fold difference of CV. By histochemical staining, it was revealed that VB to WM was heavily myelinated, whereas in the cortex staining became substantially weaker. We also found that such morphological and physiological characteristics developed in parallel and were accomplished around postnatal week 4. Considering that VB to WM is longer and more variable in length among afferents than is the intracortical region, such an enormous difference of CV makes conduction time heavily dependent on the length of intracortical region, which is relatively constant. Our finding may well provide a general strategy of connecting multiple sites irrespective of distances in the brain.",

The projections from primary visual cortex (area 17) to extrastriate visual cortical targets in the cytoarchitectonical areas 18a and 18b, and from 18a to a site in 18b, are of the first type. In contrast, the return projections from 18a and 18b to area 17 and from 18b to 18a, are of the second type. Thus each pair of connections has one element of each type, giving every circuit a nearly identical asymmetric structure.

** The responses of sensory neurons are variable, and laboratory
studies typically deal with this variability by averaging responses to
many stimulus presentations. In the real world, however, people and
animals must respond to individual stimulus events, and the brain is
thought to compensate for neuronal variability by encoding sensory
information in the responses of large populations of neurons. To
understand the way sensory information guides behavior in every-
day life, we need to understand the way information is encoded in
populations of neurons.
