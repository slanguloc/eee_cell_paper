@article{Kaneko1994Information,
    abstract = {{Connections between motor cortical neurons receiving somatosensory inputs from area 2 and large pyramidal cells in layer V were examined in the cat via intracellular injection of biocytin and immunohistochemistry of nonphosphorylated neurofilament proteins (npNFP). Biocytin was injected into pyramidal cells in layers II/III of the motor cortex that responded monosynaptically and polysynaptically to microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex and subsequently stained black by the avidin-biotinylated preoxidase complex method with diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nickel. By using a monoclonal antibody SMI-32 and a modified peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with Tris-aminophenylmethane (TAPM) and p-cresol as a chromogen, pyramidal cells in layers III and V of the motor cortex were stained red for npNFP. In particular, all the large pyramidal cells in layer V, Betz cells, displayed intense npNFP immunoreactivity not only in the perikarya but also in the dendrites. Double staining with DAB/nickel and TAPM/p-cresol showed that biocytin-filled axon varicosities of the pyramidal cells, which were thought to receive monosynaptic inputs from area 2, made contacts with npNFP-positive dendrites in layers I-III around the biocytininjected cell and in layers V-VI beneath the cell. The present results suggest that the corticocortical input from area 2 to pyramidal cells in layers II/III of the motor cortex is transferred to layer V pyramidal cells, including Betz cells, as well as to neighboring layer II/ III pyramidal cells. Since tetanic stimulation of the somatosensory cortex reportedly produces long-term potentiation in layer II/III cells of the motor cortex, it seems reasonable to assume that a given area of the somatosensory cortex can produce a long-lasting change in the activity of a given group of output cells in the motor cortex. {\copyright} 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

    abstract = {{In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of iden tified connections hetween areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways it each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to he closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections be tween areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somato sensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive thao those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainties in the reported assignment.}},

@article{Barbas1997Cortical,
    abstract = {{Cortical areas are linked through pathways which originate and terminate in specific layers. The factors underlying which layers are involved in specific connections are not well understood. Here we tested whether cortical structure can predict the pattern as well as the relative distribution of projection neurons and axonal terminals in cortical layers, studied with retrograde and anterograde tracers. We used the prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey as a model system because their laminar organization varies systematically, ranging from areas that have only three identifiable layers, to those that have six layers. We rated each prefrontal area based on the number and definition of its cortical layers (level 1, lowest; level 5, highest). The structural model accurately predicted the laminar pattern of connections in approximately 80\% of the cases. Thus, projection neurons from a higher-level cortex originated mostly in the upper layers and their axons terminated predominantly in the deep layers (4-6) of a lower-level cortex. Conversely, most projection neurons from a lower-level area originated in the deep layers and their axons terminated predominantly in the upper layers (1-3) of a higher-level area. In addition, the structural model accurately predicted that the proportion of projection neurons or axonal terminals in the upper to the deep layers would vary as a function of the number of levels between the connected cortices. The power of this structural model lies in its potential to predict patterns of connections in the human cortex, where invasive procedures are precluded.}},

@article{Miyawaki1997Fluorescent,
    abstract = {{
                Important Ca2+ signals in the cytosol and organelles are often extremely localized and hard to measure. To overcome this problem we have constructed new fluorescent indicators for Ca2+ that are genetically encoded without cofactors and are targetable to specific intracellular locations. We have dubbed these fluorescent indicators 'cameleons'. They consist of tandem fusions of a blue- or cyan-emitting mutant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), calmodulin, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13, and an enhanced green- or yellow-emitting GFP. Binding of Ca2+ makes calmodulin wrap around the M13 domain, increasing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the flanking GFPs. Calmodulin mutations can tune the Ca2+ affinities to measure free Ca2+ concentrations in the range 10(-8) to 10(-2) M. We have visualized free Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol, nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum of single HeLa cells transfected with complementary DNAs encoding chimaeras bearing appropriate localization signals. Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum of individual cells ranged from 60 to 400 microM at rest, and 1 to 50 microM after Ca2+ mobilization. FRET is also an indicator of the reversible intermolecular association of cyan-GFP-labelled calmodulin with yellow-GFP-labelled M13. Thus FRET between GFP mutants can monitor localized Ca2+ signals and protein heterodimerization in individual live cells.
