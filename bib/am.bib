abstract = {To assess the impact of thalamic synchronization on cortical responsiveness, we used conditional cross-correlation analysis to measure the probability of neuronal discharges in somatosensory cortex as a function of the time between discharges in pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons in the ventrobasal thalamus. Among 26 neuronal trios, we found that thalamocortical efficacy after synchronous thalamic activity was nearly twice as large as the efficacy rate obtained when pairs of thalamic neurons discharged asynchronously. Nearly half of these neuronal trios displayed cooperative effects in which the cortical discharge probability after synchronous thalamic events was larger than could be predicted from the efficacy rate of individual thalamic discharges. In these cases of heterosynaptic cooperativity, thalamocortical efficacy declined to asymptotic levels when the interspike intervals were >6-8 msec. These results indicate that thalamic synchronization has a significant impact on cortical responsiveness and suggest that neuronal synchronization may play a critical role in the transmission of sensory information from one brain region to another.},

abstract ={In recent years, mitochondria have emerged as important targets of agonist-dependent increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Here, we analyzed the significance of Ca2+ signals for the modulation of organelle function by directly measuring mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP levels ([ATP]m and [ATP]c, respectively) with specifically targeted chimeras of the ATP-dependent photoprotein luciferase. In both HeLa cells and primary cultures of skeletal myotubes, stimulation with agonists evoking cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals caused increases in [ATP]m and [ATP]c that depended on two parameters: (i) the amplitude of the Ca2+ rise in the mitochondrial matrix, and (ii) the availability of mitochondrial substrates. Moreover, the Ca2+ elevation induced a long-lasting priming that persisted long after agonist washout and caused a major increase in [ATP]m upon addition of oxidative substrates. These results demonstrate a direct role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in driving ATP production and unravel a form of cellular memory that allows a prolonged metabolic activation in stimulated cells.},

ABSTRACT={Pyramidal neurons of layer 5A are a major neocortical output type and clearly distinguished from layer 5B pyramidal neurons with respect to morphology, in vivo firing patterns, and connectivity; yet knowledge of their dendritic properties is scant. We used a combination of whole-cell recordings and Ca2+ imaging techniques in vitro to explore the specific dendritic signalling role of physiological action potential patterns recorded in vivo in layer 5A pyramidal neurons of the whisker-related barrel cortex. Our data provide evidence that the temporal structure of physiological action potential patterns is crucial for an effective invasion of the main apical dendrites up to the major branch point. Both the critical frequency enabling action potential trains to invade efficiently and the dendritic calcium profile changed during postnatal development. In contrast to the main apical dendrite, the more passive properties of the short basal and apical tuft dendrites prevented an efficient back-propagation. Various Ca2+ channel types contributed to the boosting of calcium signals during high-frequency firing activity, whereas A-type K+ and BKCa channels strongly suppressed it. Our data support models in which the interaction of synaptic input with action potential output is a function of the timing, rate and pattern of action potentials, and dendritic location.}}

abstract ={Previous studies have shown that layer V pyramidal neurons projecting either to subcortical structures or the contralateral cortex undergo different morphological and electrophysiological patterns of development during the first three postnatal weeks. To isolate the determinants of this differential maturation, we analyzed the gene expression and intrinsic membrane properties of layer V pyramidal neurons projecting either to the superior colliculus (SC cells) or the contralateral cortex (CC cells) by combining whole cell recordings and single-cell RT-PCR in acute slices prepared from postnatal day (P) 5–7 or P21–30 old mice. Among the 24 genes tested, the calcium channel subunits α1B and α1C, the protease Nexin 1, and the calcium-binding protein calbindin were differentially expressed in adult SC and CC cells and the potassium channel subunit Kv4.3 was expressed preferentially in CC cells at both stages of development. Intrinsic membrane properties, including input resistance, amplitude of the hyperpolarization-activated current, and action potential threshold, differed quantitatively between the two populations as early as from the first postnatal week and persisted throughout adulthood. However, the two cell types had similar regular action potential firing behaviors at all developmental stages. Surprisingly, when we increased the duration of anesthesia with ketamine–xylazine or pentobarbital before decapitation, a proportion of mature SC cells, but not CC cells, fired bursts of action potentials. Together these results indicate that the two populations of layer V pyramidal neurons already start to differ during the first postnatal week and exhibit different firing capabilities after anesthesia.},

abstract ={The rapidly activating and inactivating voltage-gated K+ (Kv) current, IA, is broadly expressed in neurons and is a key regulator of action potential repolarization, repetitive firing, backpropagation (into dendrites) of action potentials, and responses to synaptic inputs. Interestingly, results from previous studies on a number of neuronal cell types, including hippocampal, cortical, and spinal neurons, suggest that macroscopic IA is composed of multiple components and that each component is likely encoded by distinct Kv channel α-subunits. The goals of the experiments presented here were to test this hypothesis and to determine the molecular identities of the Kv channel α-subunits that generate IA in cortical pyramidal neurons. Combining genetic disruption of individual Kv α-subunit genes with pharmacological approaches to block Kv currents selectively, the experiments here revealed that Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 α-subunits encode distinct components of IA that together underlie the macroscopic IA in mouse (male and female) cortical pyramidal neurons. Recordings from neurons lacking both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (Kv4.2−/−/Kv4.3−/−) revealed that, although Kv1.4 encodes a minor component of IA, the Kv1.4-encoded current was found in all the Kv4.2−/−/Kv4.3−/− cortical pyramidal neurons examined. Of the cortical pyramidal neurons lacking both Kv4.2 and Kv1.4, 90% expressed a Kv4.3-encoded IA larger in amplitude than the Kv1.4-encoded component. The experimental findings also demonstrate that the targeted deletion of the individual Kv α-subunits encoding components of IA results in electrical remodeling that is Kv α-subunit specific.},

abstract ={Mnemonic persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) constitutes the neural basis of working memory. To understand how neuromodulators contribute to the generation of persistent activity, it is necessary to identify the intrinsic properties of the layer V pyramidal neurons that transfer this information to downstream networks. Here we show that the somatic dynamic and integrative properties of layer V pyramidal neurons in the rat medial PFC depend on whether they project subcortically to the pons [corticopontine (CPn)] or to the contralateral cortex [commissural (COM)]. CPn neurons display low temporal summation and accelerate in firing frequency when depolarized, whereas COM neurons have high temporal summation and display spike frequency accommodation. In response to dynamic stimuli, COM neurons act as low-pass filters, whereas CPn neurons act as bandpass filters, resonating in the theta frequency range (3–6 Hz). The disparate subthreshold properties of COM and CPn neurons can be accounted for by differences in the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated cation h-current. Interestingly, neuromodulators hypothesized to enhance mnemonic persistent activity affect COM and CPn neurons distinctly. Adrenergic modulation shifts the dynamic properties of CPn but not COM neurons and increases the excitability of CPn neurons significantly more than COM neurons. In response to cholinergic modulation, CPn neurons were much more likely to display activity-dependent intrinsic persistent firing than COM neurons. Together, these data suggest that the two categories of projection neurons may subserve separate functions in PFC and may be engaged differently during working memory processes.},

MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates dendrite and spine morphogenesis, has been established as a risk gene for ASD. Here, we analyzed the synaptic circuit organization of identified pyramidal neurons in the anterior frontal cortex of mice with a dorsal pallium-derived, conditional knock-out (cKO) of Met. Synaptic mapping by glutamate uncaging identified layer 2/3 as the main source of local excitatory input to layer 5 projection neurons in controls. In both cKO and heterozygotes, this pathway was stronger by a factor of ∼2. This increase was both sublayer and projection-class specific, restricted to corticostriatal neurons in upper layer 5B and not neighboring corticopontine neurons. Paired recordings in cKO slices demonstrated increased unitary connectivity. We propose that excitatory hyperconnectivity in specific neocortical microcircuits constitutes a physiological basis for Met-mediated ASD risk.},

abstract ={Corticofugal projections from the primary auditory cortex (A1) have been shown to play a role in modulating subcortical processing. However, functional properties of the corticofugal neurons and their synaptic circuitry mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we performed in vivo whole-cell recordings from layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons in the rat A1 and found two distinct neuronal classes according to their functional properties. Intrinsic-bursting (IB) neurons, the L5 corticofugal neurons, exhibited early and rather unselective spike responses to a wide range of frequencies. The exceptionally broad spectral tuning of IB neurons was attributable to their broad excitatory inputs with long temporal durations and inhibitory inputs being more narrowly tuned than excitatory inputs. This uncommon pattern of excitatory–inhibitory interplay was attributed initially to a broad thalamocortical convergence onto IB neurons, which also receive temporally prolonged intracortical excitatory input as well as feedforward inhibitory input at least partially from more narrowly tuned fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. In contrast, regular-spiking neurons, which are mainly corticocortical, exhibited sharp frequency tuning similar to L4 pyramidal cells, underlying which are well-matched purely intracortical excitation and inhibition. The functional dichotomy among L5 pyramidal neurons suggests two distinct processing streams. The spectrally and temporally broad synaptic integration in IB neurons may ensure robust feedback signals to facilitate subcortical function and plasticity in a general manner.},

Illustrative sims aimed at studying the effect of channel blockers on cell swelling.  Therapeutic opportunities.

one of the main pathophysiological phenomena observed in stroke (Barber et al 2001). Swelling of brain cells. Few minutes after brain artery occlusion. Responsible for evolution towards necrosis. when vessel occluded, ATP production drops, decrease in ATPase activity. Na/K cannot do the job Na increases inside and K outside. Reverses Na/Ca exchanges. increased Ca inside. These ionic changes associated with fast passive influx of water resulting in cell swelling. excessive release of glutamate in extracellular space ---{\&}gt; edema. Function of glutamate tx is reversed (Nicholls and Attwell, 1990). extracell glutamate triggers activation of NMDA, AMPA and metabotropic receptors and leads to more Ca and Na influx. Glu and Ca play crucial roles in neuronal necrosis during troke (Choi and Rothman, 1990, Rothman and Olney 1986, Siesjo and Bengtsson, 1989).

Aim: reproduce ion movements and cell swelling over 1 h of stroke to study the role of main neuronal and astrocytic channels, exchangers and pump involved in these phenomena. influence of these carriers on the dev of cytotoxic edema is major importance to therapeutic targets. }
